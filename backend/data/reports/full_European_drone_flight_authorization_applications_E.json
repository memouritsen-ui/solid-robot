Whether you\u2019re a hobbyist, commercial operator, or policymaker, staying informed on current and emerging drone laws is crucial. With developments in autonomous flight, AI-powered operations, and real-time data, updated policies are essential for legal compliance and operational success.\n\nIn this article, we will break down drone legislation, from existing practices to new updates, and what to expect in the following years. The article will also cover drone laws and policies, compliance tips, global regulations, and the vital question: What are the current drone laws? It is already half of the year, yet staying informed has never been more critical.\n\n## Why Understanding Drone Laws Is Essential in 2025\n\nLike any other aerial operation, deploying a drone comes with a legal responsibility. Now that more industries are relying on drone operations in their everyday work, adhering to the rules and regulations is a must.\n\nSo, whether you are a professional drone pilot, a hobbyist, or a drone manufacturer, here are some of the reasons why staying updated is crucial:\n\n* Practice legal and proper drone flights to avoid penalties and airspace violations.\n* Securing everyone\u2019s privacy and maintaining public trust.\n* Building a drone business\u2019s credibility by complying with drone regulations.\n* Availability for international operations with enough knowledge of global drone laws.\n* Creating and adapting to new frameworks and drone law updates.\n* Learning the essentials as governments worldwide are tightening national drone laws.\n\nHaving sufficient knowledge and awareness of drone laws worldwide enables operators and companies to adjust their drones and flights, thereby reducing risks and future concerns.\n\n## **Current Landscape of Drone Laws (2023\u20132024 Overview)**\n\nUnderstanding the evolution of drone laws from 2023 to 2024 provides insight into the current rules and regulations. So, what were these policies in the past years? Here are some of the following, in the:\n\n**Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the United States:**\n\n* They were able to enforce a remote ID rule for drone identification.\n* They strengthened their [BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line of Sight)](https://www.zenatech.com/drone-laws-2025-everything-you-need-to-know/) rules and pilot programs.\n* They implement a regulation requiring drones over 250 grams to be registered.\n* They also require that the commercial operators have a Part 107 certification.\n\n**European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA):**\n\n* They presented U-Space regulations for handling urban drone traffic.\n* They also updated SORA (Specific Operations Risk Assessment) to version 2.5.\n* The union also introduced certified pathways for drones that weigh up to 600 kg.\n\n**Transport Canada:**\n\n* They divided their drone operations into basic and advanced categories.\n* They also required registering drones that weigh between 250 grams and 25 kg.\n* They implement a Mandated Special Flight Operations Certificate for complex drone missions.\n\nThese are just some of the drone regulation updates; these may vary depending on the countries and their national laws.\n\n## Common Categories in Drone Laws and Policies (Globally)\n\nHere is a short table on the usual categories in developing drone laws around the world.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Category** | **Description** |\n| Registration | Drone laws may vary depending on the national or local policy on what weight or purpose requires registration. |\n| Airspace Restrictions | Focusing on the airspace restrictions for drone flights in specific locations, such as airports, military areas, or large public gatherings. |\n| Privacy Regulations | It ensures that drone operators avoid unauthorized flights and the gathering of visual data. |\n| Operator Certification | Ensuring safe operations, drone pilots must pass regulatory exams and/or have their license, depending on their purpose and local drone laws. |\n| Insurance and Liability | To cover any future risks, every drone operation should be insured and held liable. |\n\n## What Are The Changes Over Time?\n\nIn between these years, here are some of the several changes that happened in drone laws:\n\n* Many regions have mandated a remote ID system.\n* BVLOS operations have acquired traction with pilot programs.\n* New [traffic management systems](https://www.zenatech.com/traffic-management/) have emerged due to urban air mobility initiatives.\n\nThese developments are just some of the factors that pushed drone law updates in 2025.\n\n## What Are Drone Law Trends in 2025?\n\nAs the year began, the drone market and drone users continued to rise. One of its innovations that pushes the industry to another level is the use of autonomous aerial operations. Consequently, global regulatory bodies are also evolving drone laws and policies.\n\nHere are some predicted legal changes that help policymakers address the transitions of drones, which involve issues such as address, safety, privacy, and international harmonization.\n\n### Expanded No-Fly Zones\n\nIncreased drone activity near sensitive areas \u2014 including government buildings, hospitals, disaster zones, and protected heritage sites \u2014 is prompting tighter restrictions.\n\n* U.S. Example: The FAA expanded restricted zones around federal facilities, chemical plants, and significant sporting events using geofencing and Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) advisories.\n* European Example: EASA advised temporary airspace closures around high-security events like G7 summits and UEFA stadiums.\n\n### Automated Flight Regulations\n\nDrone operations in BVLOS require a legal framework to ensure collision avoidance and command accountability.\n\n* U.S. Example: The FAA launched BVLOS ARC (Aviation Rulemaking Committee) recommendations in early 2025 for scaled autonomous deliveries and remote piloting.\n* Europe Example: EASA updated SORA 2.5 with AI risk modules for autonomous drones in shared airspace.\n\n### Privacy Protections\n\nUnregulated drone surveillance has raised ethical and legal concerns in residential zones and commercial centers.\n\n* U.S. Policy Shift: States like California and New York introduced drone-specific privacy laws prohibiting facial recognition and audio capture without consent.\n* Europe Context: GDPR-compliant drone operations must anonymize or minimize the collection of personal data. Breaching this policy may result in a hefty fine.\n\n### UTM Systems (Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management)\n\nWith increased drone traffic, centralized coordination systems are necessary for airspace safety.\n\n* U.S. Progress: NASA and the FAA\u2019s UTM Pilot Program entered operational testing across major cities, integrating drones with traditional ATC.\n* Europe\u2019s Approach: U-Space Services under EASA are mandatory for certain urban drone flights, especially in controlled and congested environments.\n\n## Global Standardization vs. Local Sovereignty\n\nCross-border drone operations and international logistics demand harmonized rules, while national defense and privacy concerns require tailored laws.\n\nIn the international frameworks, ICAO and [NATO](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2017/07/28/autonomous-military-drones-no-longer-science-fiction/index.html) published interoperability guidelines for commercial and defense-grade drones.\n\nDespite global efforts, there are also regional conflicts. Countries like Germany and France maintain strict sovereign oversight over drones operating near sensitive borders.\n\n## 2025 FAA Guidelines for Drone Pilots\n\n[Legal drone operations](https://www.zenatech.com/different-types-of-drones-and-their-uses/) involve understanding the latest guidelines for drone operation. So, whatever the reason for your drone flight\u2014recreation or business\u2014here is the updated FAA things to remember for all drone operators.\n\n### Drone Registration Rules\n\n* **Weight**: Drones weighing more than 0.55 pounds (250 grams) are required to be registered with the FAA through the [FAADroneZone](https://faadronezone-access.faa.gov/).\n* **Fees**: Each drone should be registered for $5, valid for three years.\n* **Labels**: The drone must visibly display its FAA registration number.\n* **Remote ID Requirements**: All drones flying in unrestricted areas must comply with the FAA.\n\n### Remote ID regulations:\n\n* Drones must broadcast location and identification data.\n* Drones without built-in Remote ID must use an external broadcast module, unless operating in an approved FAA-recognized Identification Area (FRIA).\n\n### Limitations on Altitude\n\n* Drones **cannot fly above 400 feet** to avoid interfering with crewed aircraft.\n* Exceptions may be granted for **authorized commercial activities** with specific FAA permission.\n* Drone pilots must understand the policy under airspace restrictions, where they must apply for a waiver or have **performance-based approvals**, as it is vital to drone capabilities.\n\n### Reliable Airspace Awareness\n\n* Drone operators must avoid restricted areas, which usually include the airways, military headquarters, and national parks.\n* It is also commendable to use the FAA B4UFLY app to identify no-fly zones.\n* Monitor NOTAMs (Notices to Air Missions) for temporary flight restrictions during events, emergencies, or VIP movements.\n\n### Visual Line of Sight Requirement\n\n* At all times, a drone pilot must maintain a direct visual line of sight from their drone.\n* During night operations, it is a requirement for a drone to come with approved anti-collision lights.\n* FPV (First-Person View) flying is allowed only when a visual observer is present to maintain situational awareness.\n\n### Pilot Certification & Training\n\nAll drone pilots flying under Part 107 must complete recurrent training, which now includes emergency procedures, UAS maintenance protocols, and updates on remote ID and airspace access.\n\nNote that these guidelines apply to drone operations in the United States. Drone laws around the world may have different rules and regulations. For that reason, get to know more of some of the known regulatory bodies in the drone industry.\n\n## Legal Drone Operations: Key Regulatory Bodies and Their Roles\n\nUnderstanding who sets and enforces drone legislation is essential for compliance. In 2025, several key organizations are leading the charge in shaping national drone laws and influencing global drone laws. Get to know more about them here.\n\n### Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) \u2013 United States\n\nThe United States has the FAA to govern all civil aviation. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) are one of them. They set the standards and regulations for registration, pilot certification, airspace access, and safety protocols.\n\n**2025 Highlights:**\n\n* Expanded Remote ID enforcement for all drones over 250g.\n* BVLOS ARC recommendations adopted for autonomous operations.\n* Integration of drones into controlled airspace via [LAANC](https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/laanc) and UTM systems.\n* Updated Part 107 rules for commercial drone operators.\n\nDrone operators in the United States are required to follow the FAA rules, as they may face consequences such as fines or license suspension. In addition, the FAA\u2019s decisions often influence international standards due to its global leadership.\n\n### **European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)**\n\nEU member states are overseen by the [EASA](https://european-union.europa.eu/institutions-law-budget/institutions-and-bodies/search-all-eu-institutions-and-bodies/european-union-aviation-safety-agency-easa_en), which oversees aviation operations, including those involving drone technology. The EASA provides unified regulations through the EU drone regulation framework.\n\n**2025 Highlights:**\n\n* Mandatory U-Space services for urban drone flights.\n* Updated SORA 2.5 risk assessment for autonomous drones.\n* Certification pathways for drones up to 600 kg.\n* Harmonized privacy and data protection standards under GDPR.\n\nA legal drone operation in the EU means operators must register their drones, obtain pilot credentials, and follow U-Space protocols. EASA\u2019s unified approach simplifies cross-border drone operations within Europe.\n\n### Transport Canada\n\nTransport Canada regulates drone operations in Canada, balancing innovation with safety and privacy.\n\n**2025 Highlights:**\n\n* Streamlined registration for drones under 25 kg.\n* Updated pilot certification for advanced operations.\n* Introduced new insurance requirements for commercial flights.\n\nCanadian operators must follow Basic or Advanced operation rules, depending on mission complexity. Transport Canada\u2019s policies often mirror FAA and EASA standards.\n\n### International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)\n\nICAO sets global aviation standards and promotes harmonization of drone laws around the world. It collaborates with national authorities to ensure the safe integration of drones into international airspace.\n\n**2025 Highlights:**\n\n* Published global UAS interoperability guidelines.\n* Advocated for standardized Remote ID and [BVLOS frameworks](https://enterprise-insights.dji.com/blog/detailed-overview-of-north-america-bvlos-regulations-for-remote-drone-operations).\n* Supported cross-border drone logistics and humanitarian missions.\n\nICAO\u2019s recommendations influence national policies and help align drone law updates across countries. Operators involved in international missions must follow ICAO protocols.\n\n## **Future Outlook \u2014 What Drone Laws May Look Like in 2030**\n\nAs drone technology becomes embedded in daily life, drone legislation will evolve to address new challenges and opportunities. By 2030, drones may be as common as smartphones \u2014 used for deliveries, inspections, surveillance, and even passenger transport.\n\nSo what should we expect? Here are some of them:\n\n* Autonomous Operations as the Norm\n* Urban Air Mobility (UAM) Integration\n* AI and Machine Learning Regulation\n* Global Harmonization of Drone Laws\n* Smart City Integration\n\nAlthough no one knows what the future holds, it is an apparent fact that future drone laws can be more complex yet comprehensive, given the continuous evolution and upgrading of technology, which enhances their capabilities.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhat are the current drone laws? Answering this question reveals that the drone industry is still thriving in 2025. And with its ever-growing advancements, using this technology comes with a great responsibility. As we\u2019ve explored throughout this guide, understanding and complying with drone laws, both locally and globally, is essential for safe, ethical, and legal operations.\n\nDiscover more about drone laws and operations with [ZenaTech](https://www.zenatech.com/), ensuring you fully comply to enjoy the benefits of drone solutions.\n\n ",

All operators must now ensure their systems are fully compliant with these active regulations. This blog post focuses on the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) regulations that govern all drone operations across EU member states, as well as Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein.\n\n## **EASA drone operator registration requirements**\n\nBefore diving into Remote ID specifics, let\u2019s clarify when drone operators must register with their country\u2019s National Aviation Authority (NAA). Understanding who qualifies as a \u201cdrone operator\u201d is crucial for compliance. The \u201cdrone operator\u201d is the person or entity that owns or rents the drone.\n\nRegistration is exempted only if your drone meets one of these criteria:\n\n* Weighs less than 250 grams (including payload) and has no camera or sensor capable of capturing personal data.\n* Weighs less than 250 grams (including payload) and is classified as a toy under\u00a0[Directive 2009/48/EC](https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/sectors/toys/toy-safety_en)\u00a0(intended for children under 14).\n\nOnce registered, drone operators receive a unique operator registration number valid throughout the entire EU. This number must be physically displayed on all drones using a sticker and entered into each operational drone\u2019s Remote ID system.\n\nPro Tips*Keep your registration current and ensure the operator number is clearly visible on every aircraft. This single registration provides cross-border operational privileges across all EASA member states.*\n\n## **The EASA Drone Classification Scheme ID**\n\nEASA classifies drones based on multiple factors, including weight, capability, and operational risk. The system consists of classes and categories that work together to define compliance requirements. Similar to CE markings on consumer products, drone classes indicate the technical specifications and safety features built into the aircraft:\n\n* C0: Under 250g\n* C1: Under 900g with specific safety features\n* C2: Under 4kg with enhanced capabilities\n* C3: Under 25kg\n* C4: Under 25kg without automatic control (traditional model aircraft)\n* C5 and C6: Specific category operations with certification requirements\n\nThe three operational categories, Open, Specific, and Certified, are based on risk assessment:\n\n* Open category: Low-risk operations, typically for hobbyists and basic commercial use. No prior authorization is required, but strict limits apply, including maintaining Visual Line of Sight (VLOS), altitude restrictions, and limitations on proximity to people. The Open category has three subcategories: A1 (over people with restrictions), A2 (near people with a safe distance), and A3 (far from people).\n* Specific category: Moderate-risk operations that fall outside the Open category (most commercial BVLOS flights) require a risk assessment ([SORA](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/drones-air-mobility/operating-drone/specific-category-civil-drones/specific-operations-risk-assessment-sora)\u00a0or\u00a0[PDRA](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/drones-air-mobility/operating-drone/specific-category-civil-drones/predefined-risk-assessment-pdra)) or declaration for Standard scenarios and operational authorization from the national aviation authority (NAA). Remote ID functionality is mandatory.\n* Certified Category: High-risk operations, such as urban air mobility, passenger transport, dangerous goods transport, and complex urban operations. This category requires full certification, similar to manned aviation, including certified drones, licensed pilots, operator approval, and comprehensive safety systems.\n\nPro Tips*Most commercial drone operations fall into either the Open A3 subcategory (far from people) or the Specific category. Understanding which applies to your mission is essential for compliance planning.*\n\n## **What Is the EASA\u2019s Remote ID Regulation (2025)?**\n\nSince January 1, 2024, Remote ID has been mandatory across EASA jurisdictions for most drone operations. Here\u2019s what you need to know about compliance.\n\n**What Is Remote ID?**\n\nThink of Remote ID as a digital license plate for your drone. It broadcasts identification information that authorities and the public can receive via smartphone applications, enhancing airspace safety and accountability.\n\n**Which Drones Require Remote ID?**\n\nRemote ID is required for all drones operating in the Specific category and all drones with class marks (C1, C2, C3, C5, C6) operating in the Open category.\n\nThe following drones are exempt from Remote ID requirements:\n\n* Class C0 drones: Maximum take-off weight under 250g, including payload.\n* Tethered C3 drones: Must weigh less than 25kg, be electrically powered, attached to a tether under 50 meters, equipped with geo-awareness, and have low battery alerts.\n* Class C4 drones: Under 25kg with no automatic control modes except flight stabilization (intended for traditional model aircraft enthusiasts).\n\nEASA has adopted Direct Remote ID, also known as\u00a0[Broadcast Remote ID](https://www.elsight.com/remote-id/), as the current implementation method. This one-way broadcast system doesn\u2019t require internet connectivity and can be received by anyone with appropriate equipment in the vicinity.\n\nDrones can comply through built-in functionality or add-on modules. Both options must broadcast continuously during flight using open, documented protocols (non-ADS-B or Automatic Dependent Surveillance). The required broadcast data transmission must include:\n\n* UAS operator registration number (with verification)\n* Unique serial number of the drone\n* Real-time geographical position and height above the surface or take-off point\n* Heading and ground speed\n* Geographical position of the operator or take-off point\n* Emergency status indicator\n* Timestamp\n\nThe drone system must prevent modification of all data except the operator registration number, ensuring data integrity.\n\nPro Tips*When selecting a Remote ID add-on module, verify that it meets EASA requirements. Not all modules meet the strict European requirements.*\n\n## **How are BVLOS operations classified under the EASA Regulation?**\n\n[BVLOS](https://www.elsight.com/bvlos/)\u00a0(beyond visual line of sight) drone operations require special consideration under EASA rules. All drones in the Open category must be operated within Visual Line of Sight (VLOS), meaning BVLOS flights automatically fall under either the Specific or Certified categories.\n\nThe Specific category BVLOS operations require compliance with either:\n\n* Standard Scenarios (STS): Pre-defined scenarios with declared compliance, which include STS-01 (VLOS operations over controlled ground area) and STS-02 (BVLOS with airspace observers over controlled ground area). As of August 30, 2024, operators can no longer submit national standard scenario (STS-ES) declarations of conformity in many member states.\n* Individual Risk Assessment: A case-by-case authorization using\u00a0[SORA](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/drones-air-mobility/operating-drone/specific-category-civil-drones/specific-operations-risk-assessment-sora)\u00a0(Specific Operations Risk Assessment) and\u00a0[PDRA](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/drones-air-mobility/operating-drone/specific-category-civil-drones/predefined-risk-assessment-pdra)\u00a0(Pre-Defined Risk Assessment).\n\nThe Certified category applies to the highest-risk BVLOS operations, including urban air mobility (UAM), package delivery in populated areas, passenger transport, dangerous goods transport, and operations over assemblies of people. These operations require the same level of oversight as manned aviation, including certified aircraft, licensed pilots, and comprehensive safety management systems.\n\nPro Tips*Most commercial BVLOS applications, such as inspections, surveys, and agricultural monitoring, operate under the Specific category. Start your authorization process early\u2014obtaining approvals can take several months.*\n\n## **Network Remote ID: The Future of European Drone Connectivity**\n\nWhile Direct Remote ID is currently mandated, EASA is actively developing Network Remote ID requirements as part of the broader U-space initiative. U-space is a set of services and digital infrastructure defined by EASA and the EU to coordinate drones in low-altitude airspace, ensuring safe access while enabling commercial, industrial, and public-safety drone operations to scale.\n\nNetwork Remote ID transmits drone identification information to centralized service providers via internet connectivity, enabling tracking over longer distances, integration with air traffic management systems, coordination of complex missions in shared airspace, and enhanced situational awareness for authorities.\n\nNetwork Remote ID is mandatory for participation in U-space, Europe\u2019s UTM (Unmanned Traffic Management) system for safely and efficiently\u00a0managing drone traffic. U-space only applies in designated U-space airspace, which individual EU states activate when needed. As U-space zones expand across Europe, operators will need solutions that support both Direct and Network Remote ID.\n\nPro Tips*While Network Remote ID isn\u2019t yet universally mandated, selecting connectivity solutions that support both broadcast and network capabilities ensures you\u2019re prepared for evolving regulations.*\n\n## **Elsight\u2019s Halo: Robust BVLOS Connectivity and Remote ID for EASA-Compliant Operations**\n\nCompliance with EASA regulations requires more than just Remote ID. It demands reliable, redundant connectivity that keeps your operations safe and your data flowing. Elsight\u2019s\u00a0[Halo BVLOS communication module](https://www.elsight.com/products/allsight-drone-cloud-management-platform/heatsight-visualizing-connectivity/)\u00a0includes multilink operation that aggregates up to four cellular channels, SATcom, and other RF links into a single virtual tunnel, with advanced traffic monitoring, load balancing, and seamless handoff capabilities. The Halo is EASA compliant, including built-in Remote ID functionality, providing continuous connectivity and maximum safety for BVLOS operations. The compact module fits into a small SWaP (size, weight, and power) footprint, making it ideal for drones in a variety of EASA classes and categories.\n\nWhether you\u2019re conducting infrastructure inspections, precision agriculture operations, emergency response missions, or commercial deliveries, Halo provides the robust connectivity foundation your EASA-compliant operations demand.\n\n## **Key takeaways**\n\n* Remote ID is mandatory in all EASA states for most drone operations since January 2024.\n* Operators must register unless flying a drone weighing less than 250g with no data-capturing sensors or toy classification.\n* Drone classes (C0\u2013C6) define technical standards and safety features required for compliance.\n* Operational categories\u2014Open, Specific, and Certified\u2014determine the risk level and authorization needed.\n* Open category flights require VLOS and impose strict altitude and proximity-to-people limits.\n* BVLOS operations fall under the Specific or Certified categories and require compliance with SORA, PDRA, or STS.\n* Certified operations cover the highest-risk BVLOS missions, including UAM and deliveries in populated areas.\n* Direct Remote ID broadcasts real-time identification data and is required for all C1\u2013C6 drones. Exemptions apply only to C0 drones, C4 model aircraft, and specific tethered C3 systems.\n* U-space provides digital air traffic services for drones in designated airspace and requires Network Remote ID.\n* Elsight\u2019s Halo BVLOS communication module provides robust connectivity with built-in Remote ID functionality, supporting multilink, secure, BVLOS-ready connectivity.\n\n**FAQs**\n\n1. **Which drones need Remote ID under EASA regulations?**\n\nMost drones operating in the Open (C1\u2013C3) and Specific (C5\u2013C6) categories require Direct Remote ID. Exemptions apply only to C0 drones weighing less than 250g, C4 model aircraft, and some tethered C3 drones that meet strict technical conditions.\n\n1. **What approvals are required for BVLOS operations in the Specific category?**\n\nBVLOS operations under the Specific category require a Standard Scenario declaration (STS-02) or an operational authorization based on a SORA or PDRA. Approval timelines vary and may take several months.\n\n1. **What is the difference between Direct Remote ID and Network Remote ID?**\n\nDirect Remote ID broadcasts drone identification locally during flight. Network Remote ID sends identification data to service providers via network connectivity. Direct Remote ID is mandatory today, while Network Remote ID will be required for operations inside U-space airspace\n\nTo find out more about how Halo can help you develop your EASA-compliant BVLOS drone platform, please get in touch!\n\n**Related resources**\n\n* [Remote ID for Drones & UAV\u2019s: Ensuring Safety in the Sky](https://www.elsight.com/blog/internal-review-on-remote-id/)\n* [Compliance with FAA Remote ID Regulations](https://www.elsight.com/remote-id/faa-compliance/)\n* [Unlocking the Potential of Remote ID for the Drone Industry](https://www.elsight.com/blog/unlocking-the-potential-of-remote-id-for-the-drone-industry/)\n* [The FAA\u2019s overview of Remote ID regulations for drone pilots](https://www.elsight.com/remote-id/faa-compliance/)\n\nContact Us\n\nAwesome **resources**\n\n[Elsight\u2019s Halo Awarded through U.S. Defense Innovation Unit\u2019s (DIU) Project GI for Reliable Connectivity in Contested Domains\n\nReading time: 2 minutesElsight Selected by the DIU of the Department of War (DOW) for Phase 3 of Project G.I.

It contains all the important information that drone pilots need to know if they want to fly legally with their drone. In addition to this, the individual countries can still add their own regulations, but they are all based on the EU laws.\n\nOn the following page we provide you with an overview of the current EU drone laws 2024 with all the important information that is relevant for drone pilots. Individual sub-areas are also addressed in more detail in separate articles. In this way, we want to keep the article as comprehensive and yet as lean as possible.\n\nPlease note: The information on this page has been compiled to the best of our knowledge and is partly freely translated. Many texts are currently still available as drafts and/or in English. Should there be any changes to the regulations before or after the official launch, we will of course update this page.\n\n## New EU Drone Regulation 2024 \u2013 what has changed?\n\nWith the introduction of the EU Drone Regulation at the end of 2020, the laws surrounding unmanned air traffic were standardized within the EU \u2013 as far as possible. This inevitably led to deviations in the drone regulation from 2017 that was valid in Germany until then.\n\n* Increase of the maximum flight altitude from 100m to 120m\n* Adjustment of weight limits\n* Registration of drone pilots\n* Introduction of two different drone pilot certificates (EU certificate of competence and EU remote pilot certificate\n* eID for drones\n\nThe EU Drone Regulation is additionally structured as follows:\n\n* Classification of drones into classes (C0 \u2013 C5)\n* Classification into application scenarios (Open, Specific, Certified)\n\nThe following paragraphs describe the above points in detail.\n\n## Application scenarios of the EU Drone Regulation 2024\n\nEach drone flight is classified into one of three categories based on its characteristics: Open, Specific and Certified. The Open category is further subdivided into three subcategories A1, A2 and A3. If a drone flight cannot be assigned to any subcategory of the Open category, it automatically slips into the Specific category. If the application is not covered there either, the highest classification is reached, the Certified class.\n\nFor most hobby pilots, the Open category will apply most often, while commercial drone pilots will have to distinguish between Open and Specific. The Certified category will play little role for most drone pilots and will likely apply mostly only to industrial companies such as drone delivery services and similar businesses.\n\n## Use Case Scenario: Open\n\n* No permits necessary\n* Compulsory insurance for all drone pilots\n* Low risk drone flights\n* Flight only allowed within visual range\n* No transport of dangerous goods\n* No dropping of objects\n* Depending on subcategory/drone class Online training\u2026\n* \u2026drone pilot license\u2026\n* \u2026or registration of the drone pilot necessary\n* Minimum age may be chosen by each member state. In Germany it is 16 years, except for toy drones according to directive 2009/48/EC (drones under 250g without camera or sensors for recording) for which there is no age classification\n* A drone license plate with EU registration number (eID) of the drone pilot is required. Except for toy drones (drones under 250g and without recording function).\n* In addition, there are regulations of the respective EU member state. For example, they themselves may define so-called \u201cNo Fly Zones\u201d (no-fly zones) or certain additional restrictions, which must also be adhered to. This usually concerns airfields, military installations, prisons, government buildings and in Germany probably also residential areas (flight only with the consent of the property owner should remain, for example), see section \u201cNo Fly Zones\u201d in the article on the \u201cold\u201d drone regulation).\n* In Germany, these zones are being discussed in a current draft law and should find their way into the German Air Traffic Regulations (LuftVO) in the course of 2021. Until then, the points of the old drone ordinance will still apply, unless they deviate from the points of the EU drone ordinance mentioned in this article. In that case, the laws of the new regulation already apply.\n* Further restrictions additionally result from the drone class (C0-C4). More on this below.\n\n### Subcategory A1\n\n* Flight over people possible (depending on the C classification of the drone).\n* Overflight of uninvolved third parties must be avoided\n* No overflight over crowds of people\n\n### Subcategory A2\n\n* Flight at a safe distance from uninvolved persons (at least 30m).\n* For drones that have a \u201cSlow\u201d mode, the distance can be reduced to 5m\n\n### Subcategory A3\n\n* Flight only at a great distance from people\n* no uninvolved third parties in the entire flight area\n* minimum distance to residential, industrial and commercial areas of at least 150m\n\n### Overview graphic\n\nThe following graphic provides a coherent overview of the requirements for the Open application scenario, its subcategories A1, A2 and A3, ando the drone risk classes C0-C4 presented further below.\n\n## Use Case Scenario: Specific\n\nIf the planned drone flight does not meet one or more of the criteria listed in the Open category, it automatically slips into the Specific category. In this case, a separate SORA-GER risk assessment is required for the operation. This must be submitted to the authority in order to obtain an exemption for the planned flight.\n\nAlternatively, so-called standard scenarios can be used, which make a corresponding SORA-GER assessment superfluous and should simplify the approval process. Two standard scenarios are known to us so far:\n\n* STS-01 \u2013 VLOS (Visual Line of Sight) over a controlled area on the ground in a populated area.\n* STS-02 \u2013 BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line of Sight) over a controlled area on the ground in a sparsely populated area with airspace observer\n\nAuthorities are free to create further standard scenarios themselves. As soon as we receive more information, we will update this section.\n\nWith a LUC certificate (light UAS operator certificate), the application for authorization can be reduced to a one-time application. However, the cost and effort of a LUC certificate is not yet foreseeable. It is equivalent to a comprehensive certification of the drone pilot or the operation itself and will therefore be neither cheap nor quick to obtain.\n\n## Use Case Scenario: Certified (Certified)\n\n* Extensive approval procedures\n* Use cases: Overflight of crowds, transport of people or loads, transport of dangerous goods.\n* Not relevant for hobby pilots as well as for commercial drone pilots from the field of aerial photography\n\n## Drone classes C0-C4 of the EU Drone Regulation 2024\n\nIn the future, drones will be divided into five different risk classes marked C0 to C4. The class of a drone will be decisive for the category in which it can be flown and the requirements that are placed on the drone pilot.\n\nThe classification into a class is carried out by the manufacturer of the drone itself on the basis of established guidelines. The label will then be available to view before a drone is purchased.\n\nCurrently, there are only a handful of drones with appropriate C designations. Therefore, most current drones that will have to do without a C-label will fall into a special category and be listed as so-called inventory drones (more on this below, \u201cTransition phase for existing drones\u201d).\n\nIn this way, drones already on the market should be able to be used without any problems even with the new EU drone regulation. The following paragraphs provide an overview of the respective classes C0-C4. More details can be found in our separate article on the EU drone classes.\n\n### Drone class C0\n\nThe following drones included:\n\n* Weight of the drone is less than 250 grams (also for homebuilt drones).\n* Self-built drone over 250 grams falls under class C3 or C4\n\nSpecifications for the manufacturer/drone\n\n* The drone must not fly faster than 19 m/s (68 km/h)\n* Maximum flight altitude must be adjustable\n\nRegulations for this class\n\n* Drone pilot must read instruction manual\n* Drone pilot must register if there is a camera on the drone (in this case, it is also necessary to attach the license plate with the registration number of the drone pilot)\n* no EU drone license/EU proof of competence is necessary\n* It is allowed to fly in all subcategories of the Open application scenario, i.e. also over people (no crowds)\n\n### Drone class C1\n\nThe following drones included\n\n* Weight of the drone is less than 900 grams or the kinetic energy is less than 80 joules\n\nSpecifications for the manufacturer/drone\n\n* The drone must not fly faster than 19 m/s (68 km/h)\n* Maximum flight altitude must be adjustable\n* Return-to-home function must be available\n* Electronic identification (eID) is required\n* GEO awareness system (automatic flight restriction monitoring) is required\n\nRegulations for this class\n\n* Drone pilot must read instruction manual\n* Drone pilot must have EU certificate of competence (online training and online test), also known as \u201csmall EU drone license\u201d\n* Drone pilot must register and affix a drone license plate/badge with registration number to the drone\n* Flights from subcategory A1 in the Open application scenario possible (but no flight over people)\n\n### Drone class C2\n\nThe following drones included\n\n* Weight of the drone is less than 4 kilograms\n\nSpecifications for the manufacturer/drone\n\n* Maximum flight altitude must be adjustable\n* Return-to-home function must be available\n* Low-speed mode must be available\n* Electronic identification (eID) is required\n* GEO awareness system (automatic flight restriction monitoring) is required\n\nRegulations for this class\n\n* Drone pilot must read instruction manual\n* Drone pilot must have EU certificate of competence (online training and online test), also known as \u201csmall EU drone license\u201d\n* Drone pilot must register and affix a drone license plate/badge with registration number to the drone\n* For flights in subcategory A2 of the Open application scenario, the drone pilot must pass a theoretical test at a recognized testing center (EU remote pilot certificate or also known as \u201clarge drone driver\u2019s license\u201d)\n* A minimum distance of 30 meters from people must be maintained (subcategory A2)\n* However, when low-speed mode is activated (max. 3 m/s), the 1:1 rule applies in terms of altitude and distance to people. This means that at a flight altitude of 10m, you may fly up to 10m away from people. However, the distance must never be less than 5m.\n* Flights also possible in subcategory A3 of the application scenario Open\n\n### Drone class C3 and C4\n\nThe following drones included\n\n* Weight of the drone is less than 25 kilograms or drone is a homemade with more than 250 grams\n\nSpecifications for the manufacturer/drone\n\n* Maximum flight altitude must be adjustable\n* Return-to-home function must be available\n* Electronic identification (eID) is required\n* GEO awareness system (automatic flight restriction monitoring) is required\n* No autonomous flight allowed (class C4)\n\nRegulations for this class\n\n* Drone pilot must read instruction manual\n* Drone pilot must have EU certificate of competence (online training and online test), also known as \u201csmall EU drone license\u201d\n* Drone pilot must register and affix a drone license plate/badge with registration number to the drone\n* Flight only possible in subcategory A3 of the Open application scenario. So it is only allowed to fly outside of cities and only where no uninvolved persons can be endangered.\n\nSource: easa.europa.eu \u2013 [(EU) 2019/945](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019R0945)\n\n### Transition phase for existing drones\n\nSince there are only a few drones with the new C classification so far (as of July 2023), a transitional arrangement exists for most drones on the market (drones manufactured before Jan. 1, 2024, that do not have a C label).\n\nThe drones are allocated depending on their weight and corresponding restrictions are imposed. These can be found in summary in the list below. These drones can be flown without a C-label until Dec. 31, 2023 (validity of the transitional arrangement) depending on their weight in all subcategories of Open (A1 \u2013 A3, see list below).\n\nIt is officially called limited Open category by EASA.\n\n**Existing drones without C-classification (until 31.12.2023)**\n\n* Here, too, insurance is mandatory for all drones\n* Drone pilot must read operating instructions\n\n**Drones under 500g**\n\n* Flight possible in all subcategories (A1, A2, A3) of the Open application scenario\n* No EU drone license required (neither EU certificate of competence nor EU remote pilot certificate).\n* From 01.01.2024: EU certificate of competence required for operation of drones over 250g and under 500g in subcategory A1.\n\n**Drones from 500g and under 2kg**\n\n* Flight in subcategory A2 and A3 of the application scenario Open possible.\n* EU proficiency certificate (small EU drone license) for A3 and \u2026\n* EU remote pilot certificate (large EU drone license) required for operation in subcategory A2. Here, however, with increased distance to people (50m instead of 30m as for drones with C classification).\n* Note: Thanks to transitional regulation until 31.12.2023 also 30m for existing drones.\n\n**Drones from 2kg and under 25kg**\n\n* Flight in subcategory A3 of the application scenario Open possible\n* EU certificate of competence (small EU drone license) required for flights in subcategory A3\n\nFrom 01.01.2024, drones without C classification can be flown in A1 if the weight is below 250g (no EU drone license required) and in A3 (EU proof of competence required) if the weight is below 25kg.\n\nFlights in the A2 subcategory would therefore no longer be possible with existing drones weighing more than 250g. ([EASA FAQ](https://www.easa.europa.eu/faq/116508))\n\n## Insurance obligation\n\nRegardless of any new regulations and whether flying is private or commercial, drone insurance is always mandatory in Germany. This is already the case with the existing drone regulation.\n\nWe have summarized all information on drone liability insurance in the linked article. Our recommendation here is the favorable insurance coverage from [helden.de (ab 39\u20ac/Jahr)](https://helden.de/drohnenhaftpflicht/?src=dhpt&presetVoucher=DHPT4&utm_source=ner&utm_medium=li&utm_campaign=de.po.ro.sa)\\*.\n\n## Drone pilot registration\n\nThe online registration application for drone owners is available online. We have compiled important information on this in a corresponding news item.\n\nWe have summarized all information on registration and marking according to the current EU Drone Regulation in the following article: [**Registrierung und Kennzeichnung \u2013 eID \u2013 EU-Drohnenverordnung**](https://www.skyzr.com/registrierung-und-kennzeichnung-eid-eu-drohnenverordnung/)\n\n## EU Drone Operator Licenses of the EU Drone Regulation 2024\n\nAs mentioned several times above, the new EU Drone Regulation also introduces two new \u201cdrone operator licenses\u201d.\n\n* EU certificate of competence (\u201csmall EU drone pilot\u2019s license\u201d)\n* EU Remote Pilot Certificate (\u201clarge EU drone pilot\u2019s license\u201d)\n\nBoth \u201cdriving licenses\u201d will become mandatory as of 01.01.2021 in the respective required subcategory and C-classification (see notes above).\n\n### EU proof of competence\n\n* Online training\n* Online test\n* may be repeated as often as desired\n* probably free of charge and can be done online directly at the LBA\n* Validity: 5 years\n\n### EU Remote Pilot Certificate\n\n* EU proof of competence is a prerequisite\n* Practical self-training required (own written confirmation sufficient)\n* Theory test at a certified testing center required, usually in combination with a training course\n* Validity: 5 years\n* Fee-based, as carried out by external and certified providers\n\nIt is very likely that the official examining bodies that have been offering the proficiency test up to now will gradually switch over to the EU Remote Pilot Certificate as well.\n\nWe have summarized everything else that is important about EU drone licenses for you in our article EU Drone License \u2013 All Information.\n\n### What happens to an old issued certificate of knowledge?\n\nSo far, it is planned to keep the current drone knowledge certificates valid until the end of 2021. After that, they can be converted into the small EU drone license (i.e. EU certificate of competence).\n\nMore information will follow in a separate article.\n\n## Sources on the EU Drone Regulation\n\nThe official source for the EU Drone Regulation is EASA (European Union Aviation Safety Agency). Here you can find all official documents, draft laws and further information. The entire site is in English. Some documents are available in different languages. Particularly relevant here are the regulations [(EU) 2019/945](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32019R0945&from=EN) as well as [(EU) 2019/947](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32019R0947).\n\nThe Luftfahrt Bundesamt (LBA) [offers a short FAQ on the new EU drone regulation (german)](https://www.lba.de/DE/Drohnen/Allgemeine_Informationen/Allgemeine_Informationen_node.html), which we also used as a source for our article.\n\n## EU Drone Regulation 2024 FAQ\n\n**Since when is the current EU Drone Regulation 2024 in force?**\n\nThe current EU Drone Regulation 2024 has already been in force since 01.01.2021. Our detailed article provides all information on the current EU regulations.\n\n**Do I need drone insurance according to the EU Drone Regulation 2024?**\n\nYes, with the current EU Drone Regulation 2024, drone liability insurance is always mandatory. You are not allowed to fly without it.\n\n**Do I have to register as a drone pilot?**\n\nUnder the current EU Drone Regulation 2024, it may be mandatory to officially register as a drone pilot with the LBA. This depends on the risk class (C0-C4) of the drone used. We have summarized all the information in this article on the EU Drone Regulation.\n\n**What changes will the new EU Drone Regulation 2024 bring?**\n\nWith the current EU Drone Regulation, there have been numerous changes in the operation of drones. You can read all about the application scenarios and the new drone risk classes in our article on the EU Drone Regulation 2024.\n\n**Can I continue to use my existing certificate of knowledge?**\n\nThe German certificate of proficiency was valid until the end of 2021. It could be rewritten into the new EU certificate of competence (small EU drone license). More info can be found in the article.\n\n**What is the EU drone license?**\n\nWith the EU Drone Regulation 2024, there are two drone licenses: the small (EU Certificate of Competence) and the large (EU Remote Pilot Certificate). Depending on the drone risk class, one of the two may be necessary.

The **European Union Aviation Safety Agency** (EASA) is putting in place comprehensive regulations, effective January 1, 2024 to ensure Europe is in the forefront of drone use and pave the way for future use-cases and extensive drone use across all fields of application. Let's explore what these particular changes are, and what they mean for drone operators.\u00a0Drones are classified into open, specific, and certified categories, each with unique operational limitations and compliance requirements. For instance, the open category caters to lower-risk activities, while the certified category addresses high-risk operations.\n\n\u200d\n\n#### **C Classifications**\u200d\n\nFrom January 1st, 2024, new drones placed on the market must have a C classification marking to be used in the open category. Existing drones can still be used under certain conditions. [***Read the information on\u00a0EASA\u00a0website here.***](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones) A quick summary is:\n\n1. Drones under 250 g can be flown in subcategory A1.\n2. Drones under 25 kg can be flown in subcategory A3.\n3. Drones weighing 250 g or more require the completion of the A1/A3 online theoretical examination.\n4. Flying in subcategory A2 is only possible with a C2-class drone\u200b\u200b.\n\n\u200d\n\n#### There are seven C classifications for drones:\n\n1. C0 and C1 are for the open subcategory A1.\n2. C2 is for the open subcategory A2.\n3. C2, C3, and C4 are for the open subcategory A3.\n4. C5 and C6 are for operations that require an operating permit and are subject to a fee\u200b\u200b.\n\n\u200d\n\n#### **Mandatory Registration and Identification**\u200d\n\nA critical aspect of these regulations is that Remote Identification for Drones will become mandatory starting Januari 1st, 2024, enhancing airspace safety and accountability across the EU.[***Read the information on\u00a0EASA\u00a0website here.***](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/general-publications/remote-identification-will-become-mandatory-drones-across)\n\n\u200d\n\n#### **Operational Authorization and Stringent Standards**\u200d\n\nOperations under the specific category require authorization from National Aviation Authorities, including operations beyond visual line of sight and those involving heavier drones.\n\nRead and understand all regulations at the official [***EASA Civil Drones Page***](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones)***.***\n\n\u200d\n\n### **Globhe: Paving the Way for Compliance and Efficiency**\n\n**\u200d**Navigating these regulations might seem challenging, but Globhe simplifies the process.

It defines the conditions the operator must observe when conduct all flights in the operation:\n\n#### Where to apply?\n\nThe applicant needs to apply to the [National Aviation Authority (NAA)](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones/naa) in the state where he/she is registered as an operator.\n\n#### What is to be provided in the application for the operational authorisation?\n\nA duly filled [application form](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/downloads/137214/en), a copy of the Operations Manual (OM) (please check the [EASA Operations Manual example for UAS operations at SAIL II](/en/document-library/general-publications/easa-operations-manual-example-uas-operations-sail-ii)) and of the compliance evidence document whose content varies depending on the risk of operation. For example, for low risk operations, the documents may be very small and simple.\u00a0The OM ([example for SAIL II UAS operations](/en/document-library/general-publications/easa-operations-manual-example-uas-operations-sail-ii)) should contain all information that the staff of the operator should know in order to ensure the safety of the operation. It contains a detailed description of the intended operations, as well as an insight of the organisation\u2019s culture and the operating procedures.\n\n#### Operational authorisation with a [PDRA](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-rpas/specific-category-civil-drones/predefined-risk-assessment-pdra)\n\nIf the operation you intend to conduct is covered by one of the published [PDRAs](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-rpas/specific-category-civil-drones/predefined-risk-assessment-pdra) you need to submit to the NAA a copy of the:\n\n![Apply for authorisation](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Apply%20for%20authorisation.png)\n\n![Apply for authorisation](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Apply%20for%20authorisation.png)\n\nThe PDRA table helps you to develop the operator manual that should contain all information that a staff of the operator should know in order to ensure the safety of the operation. It contains a detailed description of the intended operations, as well as an insight of the organization\u2019s culture and the operating procedures.\n\n#### Operational authorisation without a PDRA\n\nIf the operation intended to be conducted is not covered by any PDRA you need to firstly carry out a specific risk assessment. [Regulation (EU) 2019/947](/en/document-library/regulations/commission-implementing-regulation-eu-2019947) proposes the [SORA (specific operational risk assessment)](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-rpas/specific-category-civil-drones/specific-operations-risk-assessment-sora) methodology to be used for this purpose. You can find the SORA As the AMC 1 to Article 11 of Regulation (EU) 2019/947.\n\nThis methodology helps to identify the risk level of the operation and also to identify the mitigations and operational safety objectives needed to make the operation safe. When the drone operator believes to have properly classified the operation he/she should contact the [National Aviation Authority (NAA)](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones/naa) to apply for an operational authorization and have the NAA to review the risk assessment.\n\n![Pic4](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Picture4_0.png)\n\n![Pic4](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Picture4_0.png)\n\nThen the drone operator should demonstrate compliance with all mitigations and safety objectives to be ready for completing the application.\n\n![pic5](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Picture5_0.png)\n\n![pic5](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Picture5_0.png)\n\n*The main requirements of this risk assessment can be found in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) 2019/947.*  \n  \nAt this moment the UAS operator needs to submit to the NAA a copy of:\n\n![Apply for authorisation](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Apply%20for%20authorisation_0.png)\n\n![Apply for authorisation](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Apply%20for%20authorisation_0.png)\n\n#### Authorising an operational application\n\n(Article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2019/947)  \nThe NAA will issue an operational authorisation, when it considers that the risks are adequately mitigated. Then it will provide the drone operator with the [operational authorisation](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/downloads/137214/en) as soon as possible, and the operation can then start. See below If you want to operate in a state different from the state of registration.\n\n#### Validity of an authorisation\n\nThe operational authorisation will be valid in all EASA member state for all flights conducted within the limitations and duration defined in the authorisation. However, the NAA may impose a limitation in time and/or number of flights.\u00a0  \nOperation in a state different from the state of registration (Article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2019/947) please see the [dedicated page](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-rpas/specific-category-civil-drones/operations-specific-category-state-different-one-registration).\n\n#### Drone authorisation process with an NAA\n\nAs a drone operator in the EASA Member States it is important to get an authorisation from the [National Aviation Authority (NAA)](/domains/civil-drones/naa) of the country in which your organisation is based.\n\nOperational authorisations are needed to start a drone operation in the specific category. An authorisation is not needed if the operation is covered by a Standard Scenario or you already have a Light UAS operator certificate - LUC with the appropriate privileges.\n\nThe authorization process involves submitting an application to the NAA and includes an assessment of the risk of the intended operations, the provision of the organisation\u2019s Operations Manual (OM) and the required evidence to show compliance with the applicable requirements. It is also necessary to demonstrate competence as a drone operator and evidence of training, certifications and experience will be required to demonstrate your ability to conduct operations safely and responsibly.\n\nThe National Aviation Authorities will evaluate the applications and grant authorizations. They review your application, and ensure your operations comply with the regulatory requirements. Effective communication and collaboration with the NAA is vital throughout the authorization process. Respond promptly to any requests for additional information, provide accurate details to ensure a smooth process.\u00a0 The timeline for authorization may vary depending on the complexity of your operations and the workload of the Authority. It is advisable to submit your application well in advance to allow sufficient time for processing.\n\nObtaining an authorization demonstrates your compliance with the applicable requirements and it allows you to conduct specific category operations. These requirements are proportionate to risk level of your operation.\n\nThe authorisation is issued once the operator has shown compliance with the applicable requirements of the European Drone Rules in Regulation (EU) 2019/947, which is applicable since 31 December 2020. More information can be found on the [operating a drone](/operating-drone) page. This harmonizes the rules for drone operations across the European Union, including Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein \u2013 [the EASA Member States](/domains/drones-air-mobility/topics/easa-member-states). Once you receive your authorisation, this means you can use it to operate your drone in all these countries.\n\nIn summary, contact the NAA in the EASA country where you are based. They will then guide your through the full process and inform you on what authorisations and permits you need for your type of activity.\n\nFor additional information please [contact the team](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/contact-us-aviation?select=Aviation&aviation=Drones).\n\n##### [**EASA Website create account**](/user/register)**Stay informed on** Operational authorisation**:**\n\n![EASA Website create account](/sites/default/files/inline-images/easa-website-follow-create-account.png)\n\n### Downloads\n\n#### [Form for Application for an operational authorisation for the \u2018specific\u2019 category](/en/downloads/138404/en \"form_for_application_for_an_operational_authorisation.pdf\")\n\n#### [Form for Operational authorisation for the \u2018specific\u2019 category](/en/downloads/138405/en \"form_for_operational_authorisation.pdf\")\n\n#### [EASA Operations Manual example for UAS operations at SAIL II](/en/downloads/138411/en \"easa_operations_manual_example_for_uas_operations_in_sail_ii_1.docx\")\n\n### Related Content\n\n### [Easy Access Rules for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (Regulations (EU) 2019/947 and 2019/945)](/en/document-library/easy-access-rules/easy-access-rules-unmanned-aircraft-systems-regulations-eu)\n\n### [Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/947](/en/document-library/regulations/commission-implementing-regulation-eu-2019947)\n\n## ONLINE SERVICES\n\n## READ MORE\n\n## WEBSITE\n\n## CONNECT WITH US\n\n## CAN WE HELP YOU?\n\n![EU](/themes/custom/easa_foundation/images/eu_flag_small.png)",

To assess these risk levels, [EASA](https://www.easa.europa.eu) has created several flight categories **(Open, Specific)** which require the use of standardized drones that have received a class indication **(C0-C6)**.\n\n#### [Drone Open & Specific Summary for 2024](#1)\n\n[E](#2)\n\n#### [What is the open category?](#2)\n\n[E](#3)\n\n#### [What is the Specific category?](#3)\n\n[E](#4)\n\n#### [What are standard scenarios (STS)?](#4)\n\n[E](#5)\n\n#### [How to convert your drone into a C5 class ?](#5)\n\n[E](#6)\n\n#### [How do I fly outside STS scenarios in a specific category?](#6)\n\n[E](#7)\n\n#### [What is a PDRA (Pre-Defined Risk Assessment)?](#7)\n\n[E](#8)\n\n#### [What is a SORA (Specific Operations Risk Assessment)?](#8)\n\n[E](#9)\n\n#### [What is IGRC (Intrisinc Ground Risk Class) ?](#9)\n\n[E](#10)\n\n#### [What is Final GRC (Final Ground Risk Class) ?](#10)\n\n[E](#11)\n\n#### [What are MOC (Mean Of Compliance) ?](#11)\n\n[E](#12)\n\n#### [How to reduce Final GRC with MOC2512 (M2)?](#12)\n\n[E](#13)\n\n#### [How to complete part 8 with MOC2511 ?](#13)\n\n[E](#14)\n\n#### [What is a LUC (Light UAS Operator Certificate)?](#14)\n\n## Drone Open & Specific Summary for 2024\n\n**You\u2019re not sure you can fly your drone? You don\u2019t know which regulatory category it falls into?** Understanding the different flight categories and classifications is essential for professional drone pilots.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019re going to analyse the Open and Specific categories for you, clarifying their operational parameters and all the restrictions associated with them. Nevertheless, it\u2019s important to remember that airspace management is the responsibility of each European Member State, as is the establishment of airspace zones and the requirements for flying in them.\n\n## What is the open category?\n\nThe Open Category encompasses drone operations with minimal risk to individuals, property, and other aircraft. Primarily designed for recreational drone pilots, it comprises three subcategories\u2014**A1**, **A2**, and **A3**\u2014each adapted to various drone types and operational scenarios. Common to all subcategories are strict regulations, including:\n\n* **Prohibitions on flying over groups of uninvolved individuals**\n* **A maximum flight altitude of 120 meters above ground**\n* **The requirement for visual line of sight.**\n\n### SUBCATEGORY **A1**\n\nThe Open Category\u2019s A1 subcategory permits flying over uninvolved people, exclusively designated for drones equipped with identification tags C0 or C1. These drones posses a low-risk profile, although stringent precautions are still essential to mitigate potential incidents. A1-eligible drones must weigh a maximum of 900 grams and adhere to a maximum speed of 19m/s or 68 km/h.\n\n**C0 drones**, with a maximum weight of 250g, are allowed in both A1 and A3 categories, permitting flights over uninvolved individuals and within urban areas.\n\n**C1 drones**, with a maximum weight of 900g, are only permitted in A1 and A3 operations within urban areas, with the caveat that intentional flights over uninvolved individuals are strictly prohibited. Operations within the A1 category can fly close to or even above people with very light drones but are strictly prohibited from flying over groups of people.\n\n**C0 & C1 certified drones list** (not exhaustive)**:**\n\n* DJI Mini 2 SE / 3 / 3 Pro / 4 Pro **(C0)**\n* DJI Mavic 3 Classic **(C1)**\n* DJI Mavic 3 v2.0 **(C1)**\n* DJI Mavic 3 Cine v2.0 **(C1)**\n* DJI Air 3 **(C1)**\n\n## SUBCATEGORY **A2**\n\nSubcategory A2 within the Open Category imposes stricter requirements compared to A1. It permits flights with drones weighing up to 4 kilograms and includes prohibitions over sensitive sites, along with the necessity to maintain minimum safety distances from people and residential areas. Drone pilots operating within this category are mandated to fly within 30 meters of people or 5 meters if the low-speed mode is activated.\n\nIn addition to these regulations, A2 operations are exclusively designated for drones equipped with a label **C2**. Flying close to third parties is allowed in A2, with required horizontal distances set at 30 meters or flight altitude, or 5 meters when in low-speed mode.\n\n**C2 drones**, with a maximum weight of 4kg, are permitted in both A2 and A3 categories, enabling flights close to uninvolved people and within urban areas.\n\n**C2\u00a0certified drones list** (not exhaustive)**:**\n\n* DJI Mavic 3 Enterprise\n* DJI Mavic 3 Multispectral\n* DJI Mavic 3 Thermal\n* DJI Matrice M30 / Matrice M30T\n* AgEagle Sensefly eBee\n\n### SUBCATEGORY **A3**\n\nDesigned for higher-risk operations, Subcategory A3 permits drone flights with a take-off mass of up to 25 kilograms. Flying near people and vehicles is strictly prohibited, with a minimum safety distance of 150 meters required from unconcerned people.\n\nIn addition to these regulations, A3 operations are designated exclusively for drones equipped with C class labels C2, C3 and C4.\n\n**C3 & C4** drones are allowed only in A3 category flights, with a maximum weight of 25kg, and must maintain a minimum distance of 150 meters from urban areas and uninvolved individuals, including residential, commercial, industrial, and recreational areas.\n\n**C3\u00a0certified drones list** (not exhaustive)**:**\n\n* DJI Inspire 3\n* DJI M350 RTK\n* Quantum Trinity F90+\n* WingtraOne\n* Delair UX11 / UX11 Longue\n\n## What is the SPECIFIC category?\n\nThe EASA has established the Specific Category to regulate drone operations with higher levels of risk or complexity compared to those in the Open category. To operate within this category, there are four ways to obtain approval:\n\n**1.** Submission of a declaration according to **European Standard Scenarios (STS-01 / STS-02)**\n\n**2.** Obtaining a permit for a specific type of flight by submitting a **Pre-Defined Risk Assessment (PDRA)**\n\n**3.** Obtaining authorization for a specific type of flight by submitting a **Specific Operations Risk Assessment (SORA)**\n\n**4.** Obtaining a **Light UAS Operator Certificate (LUC)**\n\n[EASA - Operational Authorisation](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-rpas/specific-category-civil-drones/operational-authorisation)\n\n## What are standard scenarios (STS)?\n\nA standard scenario represents a pre-established operation, providing pilots different possibilities for their flights. Operators are not obligated to obtain operational authorization for STS operations. Therefore, it is essential to first determine if the operation can be accommodated under an STS.\n\nThere are two types of scenarios: **STS-01** and **STS-02**. The choice of scenario depends on the environment and type of missions in which you will operate your drone: urban areas, visual line of sight flights, beyond visual line of sight flights, controlled zones, etc.\n\nCommon features of flights under STS regulations include:\n\n* **Daytime flights are permitted, while night flights are strictly prohibited.**\n* **Drones with a wingspan less than 3 meters have the possibility to fly above controlled areas on the ground, whether in Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) or Visual Line of Sight (VLOS).**\n* **For drones with a wingspan less than 1 meter, flying over assemblies of people in VLOS is allowed, and BVLOS flights are possible above sparsely populated areas.**\n* **All flights are limited to a maximum height of 120 meters.**\n\n#### **STS-01** SCENARIO\n\nDesigned for operations with a low to medium level of risk, STS01 mandates the utilization of drones classified as **C5** class. These drones must adhere to a maximum speed of 5 m/s and maintain Visual Line of Sight (VLOS) during flight. Essentially, drones operating under STS01 regulations must stay within 120 meters from the ground, adjusted for terrain, and should not carry risky materials.\n\nAdditionally, the flight zone must be controlled on the ground if in a populated area. When flying near tall artificial obstacles, the maximum height can increase by up to 15 meters with permission.\n\nTo ensure compliance with STS01 regulations, drones must have the C5 class. Some C2/C3 drones (DJI Mavic 3, Inspire 3, Matrice 350) **may need to be upgraded using certified accessory/conversion kits that include a Flight Termination System (FTS) and a Parachute Recovery System (PRS).**\n\n### how to convert your drone into a C5 class ?\n\nIf your drone is a C2 model, you have the option to upgrade it to a C5 classification using a conversion kit. On the other hand, if it\u2019s a C3 model, you can achieve the C5 status with the use of an accessory kit.\n\nUsing Dronavia\u2019s conversion kit:\n\n* DJI Mavic 3 Enterprise **(C2)** = [Kronos AD Mavic 3E](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-dji-mavic-3/) **(C5)**\n* DJI Mavic 3 Thermal **(C2)** = Kronos AD Mavic 3T (C5)\n* DJI Mavic 3 Multispectral **(C2)** = Kronos AD Mavic 3M **(C5)**\n* DJI Mavic 3 Pro/Cine **(C2)** = Kronos Mavic 3 Pro Cine **(C5)**\n\nWith Dronavia\u2019s accessory kit:\n\n* DJI M350 RTK **(C3)** [is transformed into Matrice 350 RTK](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-dji-matrice-350/) **(C5)**\n* DJI Inspire 3 **(C3)** [is transformed into Inspire 3](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-dji-inspire-3/) **(C5)**\n\n[See the official list of C5 drones](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-rpas/open-category-civil-drones)\n\n#### **STS-02** scenario\n\nReserved for high-risk operations or those conducted in sensitive airspace, STS02 mandates the usage of a **C6** aircraft and comprehensive risk assessments, along with close coordination with air traffic control authorities. Similar to the STS-01 scenario, drones must stay within 120 meters from the ground, adjusting for terrain variations. However, BVLOS flights are only possible in ground-controlled areas and outside populated areas.\n\nFurthermore, drones operating under STS02 regulations must be C6 class and must not carry dangerous goods. A buffer zone, calculated based on the drone\u2019s characteristics and the Flight Termination System (FTS), must be maintained. The maximum flight distance is limited to 1 kilometer, and the drone must remain visible within 5 kilometers.\n\nIn cases where visibility is limited, or there is an absence of an aerial observer, a pre-programmed trajectory must be followed. However, if an aerial observer is present, the maximum flight distance extends to 2 kilometers.\n\n## How do I fly outside STS scenarios in a specific category?\n\nDepending on the risk of the operation to be carried out, the specific category does not offer pre-established requirements adapted to all operations. Each UAS operator must develop its own operational scenarios. This is a fundamental difference from the open category.\n\nThere are several ways of developing your own scenarios **(PDRA / SORA / LUC)** in order to fly outside the STS scenarios, but the methodology used is always that of the SORA. Here we present the SORA methodology and how it applies to these 3 methods.\n\n## what is a PDRA (**Pre-Defined Risk Assessment**)?\n\nIn the first instance, if the STS scenarios are not suitable for your mission, you will not have to resort immediately to a manual application. The intermediate stage is called Pre-Defined Risk Assessment (PDRA).\n\nIt is based on a large number of predefined missions which involve a higher risk than STS missions and which are frequently encountered in everyday life. In summary, PDRAs are pre-configured risk assessments based largely on the SORA methodology.\n\nThese PDRAs, are approved by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) as acceptable means of complying with Regulation 2019/947. We list some of them here:\n\n**PDRA-S: STS for uncertified drones**\n\nIf you want to fly a drone without a CE C5 or C6 class in an STS scenario, you can use a PDRA-S called **PDRA-S01 / PDRA-S02**.\n\n**PDRA-G: model for frequent missions**\n\nPDRA-Gs are structured in the same way as STSs, and differ only in the higher risks associated with the mission. The models that can be used are called **PDRA-G01 / PRDA-G02 / PDRA-G03.**\n\nEASA is already anticipating the future and is now working on the publication of new PDRAs to create new scenarios and facilitate access to them for professional telepilot :\n\n**PDRA-06:** Test operations for drones up to 8 metres, in areas where at least 50% of manned aviation can be detected.\n\n**PDRA-07:** Operations in the airport area to carry out inspections.\n\n**PDRA-08:** Drone swarm operations.\n\n## what is a SORA 2.5 (**Specific Operations Risk Assessment**)?\n\nIf your flight missions still do not correspond to any appropriate STS or PDRA, the SORA (Specific Operations Risk Assessment) solution is the best way to obtain authorisation. The SORA process was developed by an international forum made up of different safety and risk experts. The name of this organization is **JARUS (Joint Authorities for Rulemaking on Unmanned Systems).**\n\nThe SORA 2.5 method produces a value called **SAIL (Specific Assurance Integrity Level)**, which is the result of combining **the ground risk (GRC)**, **the air risk (ARC)** and the corresponding mitigation measures applied. Depending on the SAIL index obtained, the operation will be considered more or less risky:\n\n**Low risk (SAIL I and II)**  \n**Medium risk (SAIL III and IV)**  \n**High risk (SAIL V and VI)**\n\nOnce the risks have been defined, **the SORA 2.5 method indicates the minimum safety requirements that an operator must meet** in order to carry out the mission safely. The cost of developing a SORA application can range from \u20ac5,000 to \u20ac10,000.\n\n## what is the **operations manual (OM)**?\n\nAccording to Regulation (EU) 2019/947 an application for an operational authorisation in the specific category **must include an Operation Manual (OM),** together with the associated specific operations risk assessment (SORA), or a PDRA table if applicable, and the evidences of compliance.\n\nIf the operator\u2019s activity has already been declared (within his country) and he has an Operation Manual (OM) drawn up before 31/12/2020, then it can be considered as an Operation Manual (OM) within the meaning of European legislation. **All you need to do is complete this manual with the new specifics of the new regulation (EU 2019/947).**\n\nAs specialists in the immersive industry, we know that the drone is an essential tool. A well-written Operation Manual ensures safe and efficient flight operations. How to obtain an Operations Manual respecting the regulations in force as well as your operation? **Only one step: Fill out the form above (10 minutes)**\n\nAt the end of this step, we will send you the document and invite you to reread it to fully understand it.

We have a team of experts who master the complexities of drone regulations in France and Europe, offering a quality service that meets your specific needs.\n\nJordan Perrin\n\nInstructor and consultant, Immersive Ambition\n\n[create your operations manual (OM) easily](https://www.immersive-ambition.fr/en/manex)\n\n## What is IGRC (**INTRINSIC** **Ground Risk Class**) ?\n\n**INTRINSIC GROUND RISK CLASS**   \n**(Step #2 of SORA Methodology)**\n\nThe Ground Risk Class (GRC) is defined as the risk of a person being hit by a drone during a flight mission. To determine the intrinsic GRC , professional telepilots must take into account appendix F of the SORA 2.5 method, a table which takes into account the dimensions of the UAV, the maximum speed of the UAV and the population density present for the flight operation.\n\nOnce the initial intrinsic GRC has been determined, mitigation measures must be applied to reduce the risk and thus obtain the value of the final GRC.These mitigation measures are as follows:\n\n* There are effective engineered containment systems in place.\n* Systems that reduce the effects of the impact on people on the ground.\n* An effective emergency response plan is in place, available for use and has been validated.\n\n## What is FINAL GRC (**FINAL** **Ground Risk Class**) ?\n\n**FINAL GRC**  \n**(Step #3 of the SORA methodology)**\n\nAccording to this SORA methodology, the robustness of the mitigation measures is defined by the level of integrity offered by each of the mitigation measures and the level of assurance that the mitigation measures have achieved (for example, the method by which it is proven).\n\nThus, we find 3 types of robustness levels:\n\n**Low robustness**  \n**Medium robustness**  \n**High robustness**\n\nThus, depending on the robustness values of the mitigation measures applied, the GRC value can be reduced and the final GRC value obtained, always bearing in mind that it cannot be reduced below the minimum value in the resulting column of the \u201cUAS intrinsic ground risk class index\u201d table.\n\n## WHAT ARE MOC **(MEANS OF COMPLIANCE)** ?\n\nAn MoC (Means of Compliance) is a way for professional drone operators to demonstrate that they comply with the regulations and standards that apply to their activities, and to guarantee the quality and safety of the products they use. To obtain it, it is necessary to meet the current regulatory requirements published by EASA, the European Union\u2019s Aviation Safety Agency.\n\nIn addition to the quality and safety offered by a product that complies with the MOCs proposed by EASA, **professional drone operators can more easily obtain a SORA (Specific Operations Risk Assessment) or a PDRA (Pre-Defined Risk Assessment), flight authorisations issued for complex missions in a specific category.**\n\n\u201cAMCs are non-binding standards adopted by EASA to illustrate means to establish compliance with the Basic Regulation and its Implementing Rules.\n\nThe AMCs issued by EASA are not of a legislative nature. They cannot create additional obligations on the regulated persons, who may decide to show compliance with the applicable requirements using other means. However, as the legislator wanted such material to provide for legal certainty and to contribute to uniform implementation, it provided the AMC adopted by EASA with a presumption of compliance with the rules, so that it commits competent authorities to recognise regulated persons complying with EASA AMC as complying with the law.\u201d\n\n[Definition by EASA](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/acceptable-means-compliance-amcs-and-alternative-means-compliance-altmocs)\n\n### how to REDUCE FINAL GRC with **MOC2512 (M2)**?\n\nAs professional telepilots, it is important to be aware of the means of compliance for M2 mitigations of medium robustness, enabling you to reduce your final GRC score during the SORA application.\n\nMOC2512 (M2) designates the level of robustness required for the safety system in the event of a drone losing control and falling to the ground. To achieve this, the safety system must :\n\nReduce the effect of ground impact  \nOperate reliably in the event of loss of control  \nNot introduce any additional risk\n\nDronavia\u2019s Kronos Parachute Recovery Systems (PRS) for [DJI Inspire 3](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-dji-inspire-3/) and [Matrice 300/350](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-dji-matrice-350/) as well as for [DJI Mavic 3](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-dji-mavic-3/) comply with MOC25-12 (M2) published by the EASA and therefore reduce the final GRC score by one point.\n\n**To benefit from this score reduction, Dronavia is able to provide all the necessary proof (declaration of conformity, test reports, etc.) requested by the national authority and/or the EASA.**\n\n### how to complete part 8 \u00a0 with **MOC2511** ?\n\nStep 8 (Containment Requirements) of the SORA 2.5 discusses the risk of losing control of the aircraft and flying into adjacent areas where the risk to third parties (on the ground or in the air) may be greater. If the aircraft is not adequately designed, there may be probable reasons that could lead to an exit from the area of operation.\n\nThe operator must take into account a matrix which combines the SAIL and the final GRC of the adjacent area, explained in appendix E of the SORA 2.5. For any reinforced containment system, the operator must: \u201cdeclare compliance with the provisions of the document \u201cMeans of compliance with Light UAS.2511 \u2013 Reinforced containment\u201d, or provide proof of this compliance (technical description, test reports, etc.) when applying for a permit. \u201c\n\nThe Dronavia flight termination systems (FTS) of the Kronos range for [DJI Inspire 3](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronons-fts-inspire3/) and [Matrice 300/350](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-fts-matrice350/) as well as for [DJI Mavic 3](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/zephyr-fts-mavic3/) are compliant with MOC25-11 published by EASA and allow compliance with step 8 during the SORA application.\n\n**To benefit from this compliance, Dronavia is able to provide all the necessary evidence (declaration of conformity, test reports, ground risk buffer, etc.) requested by the national authority and/or the EASA.**\n\n## what is a LUC **(Light UAS Operator Certificate)**?\n\nThe latest solution is aimed at all users who have to submit activity reports for a well-defined type of operation on a very regular basis.\n\nLUC stands for Light UAS Operator Certificate and means that you are particularly familiar with the risks and safety measures to be applied for a specific type of drone operation.

Whether you\u2019re a hobbyist, commercial operator, or policymaker, staying informed on current and emerging drone laws is crucial. With developments in autonomous flight, AI-powered operations, and real-time data, updated policies are essential for legal compliance and operational success.\n\nIn this article, we will break down drone legislation, from existing practices to new updates, and what to expect in the following years. The article will also cover drone laws and policies, compliance tips, global regulations, and the vital question: What are the current drone laws? It is already half of the year, yet staying informed has never been more critical.\n\n## Why Understanding Drone Laws Is Essential in 2025\n\nLike any other aerial operation, deploying a drone comes with a legal responsibility. Now that more industries are relying on drone operations in their everyday work, adhering to the rules and regulations is a must.\n\nSo, whether you are a professional drone pilot, a hobbyist, or a drone manufacturer, here are some of the reasons why staying updated is crucial:\n\n* Practice legal and proper drone flights to avoid penalties and airspace violations.\n* Securing everyone\u2019s privacy and maintaining public trust.\n* Building a drone business\u2019s credibility by complying with drone regulations.\n* Availability for international operations with enough knowledge of global drone laws.\n* Creating and adapting to new frameworks and drone law updates.\n* Learning the essentials as governments worldwide are tightening national drone laws.\n\nHaving sufficient knowledge and awareness of drone laws worldwide enables operators and companies to adjust their drones and flights, thereby reducing risks and future concerns.\n\n## **Current Landscape of Drone Laws (2023\u20132024 Overview)**\n\nUnderstanding the evolution of drone laws from 2023 to 2024 provides insight into the current rules and regulations. So, what were these policies in the past years? Here are some of the following, in the:\n\n**Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the United States:**\n\n* They were able to enforce a remote ID rule for drone identification.\n* They strengthened their [BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line of Sight)](https://www.zenatech.com/drone-laws-2025-everything-you-need-to-know/) rules and pilot programs.\n* They implement a regulation requiring drones over 250 grams to be registered.\n* They also require that the commercial operators have a Part 107 certification.\n\n**European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA):**\n\n* They presented U-Space regulations for handling urban drone traffic.\n* They also updated SORA (Specific Operations Risk Assessment) to version 2.5.\n* The union also introduced certified pathways for drones that weigh up to 600 kg.\n\n**Transport Canada:**\n\n* They divided their drone operations into basic and advanced categories.\n* They also required registering drones that weigh between 250 grams and 25 kg.\n* They implement a Mandated Special Flight Operations Certificate for complex drone missions.\n\nThese are just some of the drone regulation updates; these may vary depending on the countries and their national laws.\n\n## Common Categories in Drone Laws and Policies (Globally)\n\nHere is a short table on the usual categories in developing drone laws around the world.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Category** | **Description** |\n| Registration | Drone laws may vary depending on the national or local policy on what weight or purpose requires registration. |\n| Airspace Restrictions | Focusing on the airspace restrictions for drone flights in specific locations, such as airports, military areas, or large public gatherings. |\n| Privacy Regulations | It ensures that drone operators avoid unauthorized flights and the gathering of visual data. |\n| Operator Certification | Ensuring safe operations, drone pilots must pass regulatory exams and/or have their license, depending on their purpose and local drone laws. |\n| Insurance and Liability | To cover any future risks, every drone operation should be insured and held liable. |\n\n## What Are The Changes Over Time?\n\nIn between these years, here are some of the several changes that happened in drone laws:\n\n* Many regions have mandated a remote ID system.\n* BVLOS operations have acquired traction with pilot programs.\n* New [traffic management systems](https://www.zenatech.com/traffic-management/) have emerged due to urban air mobility initiatives.\n\nThese developments are just some of the factors that pushed drone law updates in 2025.\n\n## What Are Drone Law Trends in 2025?\n\nAs the year began, the drone market and drone users continued to rise. One of its innovations that pushes the industry to another level is the use of autonomous aerial operations. Consequently, global regulatory bodies are also evolving drone laws and policies.\n\nHere are some predicted legal changes that help policymakers address the transitions of drones, which involve issues such as address, safety, privacy, and international harmonization.\n\n### Expanded No-Fly Zones\n\nIncreased drone activity near sensitive areas \u2014 including government buildings, hospitals, disaster zones, and protected heritage sites \u2014 is prompting tighter restrictions.\n\n* U.S. Example: The FAA expanded restricted zones around federal facilities, chemical plants, and significant sporting events using geofencing and Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) advisories.\n* European Example: EASA advised temporary airspace closures around high-security events like G7 summits and UEFA stadiums.\n\n### Automated Flight Regulations\n\nDrone operations in BVLOS require a legal framework to ensure collision avoidance and command accountability.\n\n* U.S. Example: The FAA launched BVLOS ARC (Aviation Rulemaking Committee) recommendations in early 2025 for scaled autonomous deliveries and remote piloting.\n* Europe Example: EASA updated SORA 2.5 with AI risk modules for autonomous drones in shared airspace.\n\n### Privacy Protections\n\nUnregulated drone surveillance has raised ethical and legal concerns in residential zones and commercial centers.\n\n* U.S. Policy Shift: States like California and New York introduced drone-specific privacy laws prohibiting facial recognition and audio capture without consent.\n* Europe Context: GDPR-compliant drone operations must anonymize or minimize the collection of personal data. Breaching this policy may result in a hefty fine.\n\n### UTM Systems (Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management)\n\nWith increased drone traffic, centralized coordination systems are necessary for airspace safety.\n\n* U.S. Progress: NASA and the FAA\u2019s UTM Pilot Program entered operational testing across major cities, integrating drones with traditional ATC.\n* Europe\u2019s Approach: U-Space Services under EASA are mandatory for certain urban drone flights, especially in controlled and congested environments.\n\n## Global Standardization vs. Local Sovereignty\n\nCross-border drone operations and international logistics demand harmonized rules, while national defense and privacy concerns require tailored laws.\n\nIn the international frameworks, ICAO and [NATO](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2017/07/28/autonomous-military-drones-no-longer-science-fiction/index.html) published interoperability guidelines for commercial and defense-grade drones.\n\nDespite global efforts, there are also regional conflicts. Countries like Germany and France maintain strict sovereign oversight over drones operating near sensitive borders.\n\n## 2025 FAA Guidelines for Drone Pilots\n\n[Legal drone operations](https://www.zenatech.com/different-types-of-drones-and-their-uses/) involve understanding the latest guidelines for drone operation. So, whatever the reason for your drone flight\u2014recreation or business\u2014here is the updated FAA things to remember for all drone operators.\n\n### Drone Registration Rules\n\n* **Weight**: Drones weighing more than 0.55 pounds (250 grams) are required to be registered with the FAA through the [FAADroneZone](https://faadronezone-access.faa.gov/).\n* **Fees**: Each drone should be registered for $5, valid for three years.\n* **Labels**: The drone must visibly display its FAA registration number.\n* **Remote ID Requirements**: All drones flying in unrestricted areas must comply with the FAA.\n\n### Remote ID regulations:\n\n* Drones must broadcast location and identification data.\n* Drones without built-in Remote ID must use an external broadcast module, unless operating in an approved FAA-recognized Identification Area (FRIA).\n\n### Limitations on Altitude\n\n* Drones **cannot fly above 400 feet** to avoid interfering with crewed aircraft.\n* Exceptions may be granted for **authorized commercial activities** with specific FAA permission.\n* Drone pilots must understand the policy under airspace restrictions, where they must apply for a waiver or have **performance-based approvals**, as it is vital to drone capabilities.\n\n### Reliable Airspace Awareness\n\n* Drone operators must avoid restricted areas, which usually include the airways, military headquarters, and national parks.\n* It is also commendable to use the FAA B4UFLY app to identify no-fly zones.\n* Monitor NOTAMs (Notices to Air Missions) for temporary flight restrictions during events, emergencies, or VIP movements.\n\n### Visual Line of Sight Requirement\n\n* At all times, a drone pilot must maintain a direct visual line of sight from their drone.\n* During night operations, it is a requirement for a drone to come with approved anti-collision lights.\n* FPV (First-Person View) flying is allowed only when a visual observer is present to maintain situational awareness.\n\n### Pilot Certification & Training\n\nAll drone pilots flying under Part 107 must complete recurrent training, which now includes emergency procedures, UAS maintenance protocols, and updates on remote ID and airspace access.\n\nNote that these guidelines apply to drone operations in the United States. Drone laws around the world may have different rules and regulations. For that reason, get to know more of some of the known regulatory bodies in the drone industry.\n\n## Legal Drone Operations: Key Regulatory Bodies and Their Roles\n\nUnderstanding who sets and enforces drone legislation is essential for compliance. In 2025, several key organizations are leading the charge in shaping national drone laws and influencing global drone laws. Get to know more about them here.\n\n### Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) \u2013 United States\n\nThe United States has the FAA to govern all civil aviation. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) are one of them. They set the standards and regulations for registration, pilot certification, airspace access, and safety protocols.\n\n**2025 Highlights:**\n\n* Expanded Remote ID enforcement for all drones over 250g.\n* BVLOS ARC recommendations adopted for autonomous operations.\n* Integration of drones into controlled airspace via [LAANC](https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/laanc) and UTM systems.\n* Updated Part 107 rules for commercial drone operators.\n\nDrone operators in the United States are required to follow the FAA rules, as they may face consequences such as fines or license suspension. In addition, the FAA\u2019s decisions often influence international standards due to its global leadership.\n\n### **European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)**\n\nEU member states are overseen by the [EASA](https://european-union.europa.eu/institutions-law-budget/institutions-and-bodies/search-all-eu-institutions-and-bodies/european-union-aviation-safety-agency-easa_en), which oversees aviation operations, including those involving drone technology. The EASA provides unified regulations through the EU drone regulation framework.\n\n**2025 Highlights:**\n\n* Mandatory U-Space services for urban drone flights.\n* Updated SORA 2.5 risk assessment for autonomous drones.\n* Certification pathways for drones up to 600 kg.\n* Harmonized privacy and data protection standards under GDPR.\n\nA legal drone operation in the EU means operators must register their drones, obtain pilot credentials, and follow U-Space protocols. EASA\u2019s unified approach simplifies cross-border drone operations within Europe.\n\n### Transport Canada\n\nTransport Canada regulates drone operations in Canada, balancing innovation with safety and privacy.\n\n**2025 Highlights:**\n\n* Streamlined registration for drones under 25 kg.\n* Updated pilot certification for advanced operations.\n* Introduced new insurance requirements for commercial flights.\n\nCanadian operators must follow Basic or Advanced operation rules, depending on mission complexity. Transport Canada\u2019s policies often mirror FAA and EASA standards.\n\n### International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)\n\nICAO sets global aviation standards and promotes harmonization of drone laws around the world. It collaborates with national authorities to ensure the safe integration of drones into international airspace.\n\n**2025 Highlights:**\n\n* Published global UAS interoperability guidelines.\n* Advocated for standardized Remote ID and [BVLOS frameworks](https://enterprise-insights.dji.com/blog/detailed-overview-of-north-america-bvlos-regulations-for-remote-drone-operations).\n* Supported cross-border drone logistics and humanitarian missions.\n\nICAO\u2019s recommendations influence national policies and help align drone law updates across countries. Operators involved in international missions must follow ICAO protocols.\n\n## **Future Outlook \u2014 What Drone Laws May Look Like in 2030**\n\nAs drone technology becomes embedded in daily life, drone legislation will evolve to address new challenges and opportunities. By 2030, drones may be as common as smartphones \u2014 used for deliveries, inspections, surveillance, and even passenger transport.\n\nSo what should we expect? Here are some of them:\n\n* Autonomous Operations as the Norm\n* Urban Air Mobility (UAM) Integration\n* AI and Machine Learning Regulation\n* Global Harmonization of Drone Laws\n* Smart City Integration\n\nAlthough no one knows what the future holds, it is an apparent fact that future drone laws can be more complex yet comprehensive, given the continuous evolution and upgrading of technology, which enhances their capabilities.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhat are the current drone laws? Answering this question reveals that the drone industry is still thriving in 2025. And with its ever-growing advancements, using this technology comes with a great responsibility. As we\u2019ve explored throughout this guide, understanding and complying with drone laws, both locally and globally, is essential for safe, ethical, and legal operations.\n\nDiscover more about drone laws and operations with [ZenaTech](https://www.zenatech.com/), ensuring you fully comply to enjoy the benefits of drone solutions.\n\n ",

All operators must now ensure their systems are fully compliant with these active regulations. This blog post focuses on the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) regulations that govern all drone operations across EU member states, as well as Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein.\n\n## **EASA drone operator registration requirements**\n\nBefore diving into Remote ID specifics, let\u2019s clarify when drone operators must register with their country\u2019s National Aviation Authority (NAA). Understanding who qualifies as a \u201cdrone operator\u201d is crucial for compliance. The \u201cdrone operator\u201d is the person or entity that owns or rents the drone.\n\nRegistration is exempted only if your drone meets one of these criteria:\n\n* Weighs less than 250 grams (including payload) and has no camera or sensor capable of capturing personal data.\n* Weighs less than 250 grams (including payload) and is classified as a toy under\u00a0[Directive 2009/48/EC](https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/sectors/toys/toy-safety_en)\u00a0(intended for children under 14).\n\nOnce registered, drone operators receive a unique operator registration number valid throughout the entire EU. This number must be physically displayed on all drones using a sticker and entered into each operational drone\u2019s Remote ID system.\n\nPro Tips*Keep your registration current and ensure the operator number is clearly visible on every aircraft. This single registration provides cross-border operational privileges across all EASA member states.*\n\n## **The EASA Drone Classification Scheme ID**\n\nEASA classifies drones based on multiple factors, including weight, capability, and operational risk. The system consists of classes and categories that work together to define compliance requirements. Similar to CE markings on consumer products, drone classes indicate the technical specifications and safety features built into the aircraft:\n\n* C0: Under 250g\n* C1: Under 900g with specific safety features\n* C2: Under 4kg with enhanced capabilities\n* C3: Under 25kg\n* C4: Under 25kg without automatic control (traditional model aircraft)\n* C5 and C6: Specific category operations with certification requirements\n\nThe three operational categories, Open, Specific, and Certified, are based on risk assessment:\n\n* Open category: Low-risk operations, typically for hobbyists and basic commercial use. No prior authorization is required, but strict limits apply, including maintaining Visual Line of Sight (VLOS), altitude restrictions, and limitations on proximity to people. The Open category has three subcategories: A1 (over people with restrictions), A2 (near people with a safe distance), and A3 (far from people).\n* Specific category: Moderate-risk operations that fall outside the Open category (most commercial BVLOS flights) require a risk assessment ([SORA](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/drones-air-mobility/operating-drone/specific-category-civil-drones/specific-operations-risk-assessment-sora)\u00a0or\u00a0[PDRA](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/drones-air-mobility/operating-drone/specific-category-civil-drones/predefined-risk-assessment-pdra)) or declaration for Standard scenarios and operational authorization from the national aviation authority (NAA). Remote ID functionality is mandatory.\n* Certified Category: High-risk operations, such as urban air mobility, passenger transport, dangerous goods transport, and complex urban operations. This category requires full certification, similar to manned aviation, including certified drones, licensed pilots, operator approval, and comprehensive safety systems.\n\nPro Tips*Most commercial drone operations fall into either the Open A3 subcategory (far from people) or the Specific category. Understanding which applies to your mission is essential for compliance planning.*\n\n## **What Is the EASA\u2019s Remote ID Regulation (2025)?**\n\nSince January 1, 2024, Remote ID has been mandatory across EASA jurisdictions for most drone operations. Here\u2019s what you need to know about compliance.\n\n**What Is Remote ID?**\n\nThink of Remote ID as a digital license plate for your drone. It broadcasts identification information that authorities and the public can receive via smartphone applications, enhancing airspace safety and accountability.\n\n**Which Drones Require Remote ID?**\n\nRemote ID is required for all drones operating in the Specific category and all drones with class marks (C1, C2, C3, C5, C6) operating in the Open category.\n\nThe following drones are exempt from Remote ID requirements:\n\n* Class C0 drones: Maximum take-off weight under 250g, including payload.\n* Tethered C3 drones: Must weigh less than 25kg, be electrically powered, attached to a tether under 50 meters, equipped with geo-awareness, and have low battery alerts.\n* Class C4 drones: Under 25kg with no automatic control modes except flight stabilization (intended for traditional model aircraft enthusiasts).\n\nEASA has adopted Direct Remote ID, also known as\u00a0[Broadcast Remote ID](https://www.elsight.com/remote-id/), as the current implementation method. This one-way broadcast system doesn\u2019t require internet connectivity and can be received by anyone with appropriate equipment in the vicinity.\n\nDrones can comply through built-in functionality or add-on modules. Both options must broadcast continuously during flight using open, documented protocols (non-ADS-B or Automatic Dependent Surveillance). The required broadcast data transmission must include:\n\n* UAS operator registration number (with verification)\n* Unique serial number of the drone\n* Real-time geographical position and height above the surface or take-off point\n* Heading and ground speed\n* Geographical position of the operator or take-off point\n* Emergency status indicator\n* Timestamp\n\nThe drone system must prevent modification of all data except the operator registration number, ensuring data integrity.\n\nPro Tips*When selecting a Remote ID add-on module, verify that it meets EASA requirements. Not all modules meet the strict European requirements.*\n\n## **How are BVLOS operations classified under the EASA Regulation?**\n\n[BVLOS](https://www.elsight.com/bvlos/)\u00a0(beyond visual line of sight) drone operations require special consideration under EASA rules. All drones in the Open category must be operated within Visual Line of Sight (VLOS), meaning BVLOS flights automatically fall under either the Specific or Certified categories.\n\nThe Specific category BVLOS operations require compliance with either:\n\n* Standard Scenarios (STS): Pre-defined scenarios with declared compliance, which include STS-01 (VLOS operations over controlled ground area) and STS-02 (BVLOS with airspace observers over controlled ground area). As of August 30, 2024, operators can no longer submit national standard scenario (STS-ES) declarations of conformity in many member states.\n* Individual Risk Assessment: A case-by-case authorization using\u00a0[SORA](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/drones-air-mobility/operating-drone/specific-category-civil-drones/specific-operations-risk-assessment-sora)\u00a0(Specific Operations Risk Assessment) and\u00a0[PDRA](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/drones-air-mobility/operating-drone/specific-category-civil-drones/predefined-risk-assessment-pdra)\u00a0(Pre-Defined Risk Assessment).\n\nThe Certified category applies to the highest-risk BVLOS operations, including urban air mobility (UAM), package delivery in populated areas, passenger transport, dangerous goods transport, and operations over assemblies of people. These operations require the same level of oversight as manned aviation, including certified aircraft, licensed pilots, and comprehensive safety management systems.\n\nPro Tips*Most commercial BVLOS applications, such as inspections, surveys, and agricultural monitoring, operate under the Specific category. Start your authorization process early\u2014obtaining approvals can take several months.*\n\n## **Network Remote ID: The Future of European Drone Connectivity**\n\nWhile Direct Remote ID is currently mandated, EASA is actively developing Network Remote ID requirements as part of the broader U-space initiative. U-space is a set of services and digital infrastructure defined by EASA and the EU to coordinate drones in low-altitude airspace, ensuring safe access while enabling commercial, industrial, and public-safety drone operations to scale.\n\nNetwork Remote ID transmits drone identification information to centralized service providers via internet connectivity, enabling tracking over longer distances, integration with air traffic management systems, coordination of complex missions in shared airspace, and enhanced situational awareness for authorities.\n\nNetwork Remote ID is mandatory for participation in U-space, Europe\u2019s UTM (Unmanned Traffic Management) system for safely and efficiently\u00a0managing drone traffic. U-space only applies in designated U-space airspace, which individual EU states activate when needed. As U-space zones expand across Europe, operators will need solutions that support both Direct and Network Remote ID.\n\nPro Tips*While Network Remote ID isn\u2019t yet universally mandated, selecting connectivity solutions that support both broadcast and network capabilities ensures you\u2019re prepared for evolving regulations.*\n\n## **Elsight\u2019s Halo: Robust BVLOS Connectivity and Remote ID for EASA-Compliant Operations**\n\nCompliance with EASA regulations requires more than just Remote ID. It demands reliable, redundant connectivity that keeps your operations safe and your data flowing. Elsight\u2019s\u00a0[Halo BVLOS communication module](https://www.elsight.com/products/allsight-drone-cloud-management-platform/heatsight-visualizing-connectivity/)\u00a0includes multilink operation that aggregates up to four cellular channels, SATcom, and other RF links into a single virtual tunnel, with advanced traffic monitoring, load balancing, and seamless handoff capabilities. The Halo is EASA compliant, including built-in Remote ID functionality, providing continuous connectivity and maximum safety for BVLOS operations. The compact module fits into a small SWaP (size, weight, and power) footprint, making it ideal for drones in a variety of EASA classes and categories.\n\nWhether you\u2019re conducting infrastructure inspections, precision agriculture operations, emergency response missions, or commercial deliveries, Halo provides the robust connectivity foundation your EASA-compliant operations demand.\n\n## **Key takeaways**\n\n* Remote ID is mandatory in all EASA states for most drone operations since January 2024.\n* Operators must register unless flying a drone weighing less than 250g with no data-capturing sensors or toy classification.\n* Drone classes (C0\u2013C6) define technical standards and safety features required for compliance.\n* Operational categories\u2014Open, Specific, and Certified\u2014determine the risk level and authorization needed.\n* Open category flights require VLOS and impose strict altitude and proximity-to-people limits.\n* BVLOS operations fall under the Specific or Certified categories and require compliance with SORA, PDRA, or STS.\n* Certified operations cover the highest-risk BVLOS missions, including UAM and deliveries in populated areas.\n* Direct Remote ID broadcasts real-time identification data and is required for all C1\u2013C6 drones. Exemptions apply only to C0 drones, C4 model aircraft, and specific tethered C3 systems.\n* U-space provides digital air traffic services for drones in designated airspace and requires Network Remote ID.\n* Elsight\u2019s Halo BVLOS communication module provides robust connectivity with built-in Remote ID functionality, supporting multilink, secure, BVLOS-ready connectivity.\n\n**FAQs**\n\n1. **Which drones need Remote ID under EASA regulations?**\n\nMost drones operating in the Open (C1\u2013C3) and Specific (C5\u2013C6) categories require Direct Remote ID. Exemptions apply only to C0 drones weighing less than 250g, C4 model aircraft, and some tethered C3 drones that meet strict technical conditions.\n\n1. **What approvals are required for BVLOS operations in the Specific category?**\n\nBVLOS operations under the Specific category require a Standard Scenario declaration (STS-02) or an operational authorization based on a SORA or PDRA. Approval timelines vary and may take several months.\n\n1. **What is the difference between Direct Remote ID and Network Remote ID?**\n\nDirect Remote ID broadcasts drone identification locally during flight. Network Remote ID sends identification data to service providers via network connectivity. Direct Remote ID is mandatory today, while Network Remote ID will be required for operations inside U-space airspace\n\nTo find out more about how Halo can help you develop your EASA-compliant BVLOS drone platform, please get in touch!\n\n**Related resources**\n\n* [Remote ID for Drones & UAV\u2019s: Ensuring Safety in the Sky](https://www.elsight.com/blog/internal-review-on-remote-id/)\n* [Compliance with FAA Remote ID Regulations](https://www.elsight.com/remote-id/faa-compliance/)\n* [Unlocking the Potential of Remote ID for the Drone Industry](https://www.elsight.com/blog/unlocking-the-potential-of-remote-id-for-the-drone-industry/)\n* [The FAA\u2019s overview of Remote ID regulations for drone pilots](https://www.elsight.com/remote-id/faa-compliance/)\n\nContact Us\n\nAwesome **resources**\n\n[Elsight\u2019s Halo Awarded through U.S. Defense Innovation Unit\u2019s (DIU) Project GI for Reliable Connectivity in Contested Domains\n\nReading time: 2 minutesElsight Selected by the DIU of the Department of War (DOW) for Phase 3 of Project G.I.

It contains all the important information that drone pilots need to know if they want to fly legally with their drone. In addition to this, the individual countries can still add their own regulations, but they are all based on the EU laws.\n\nOn the following page we provide you with an overview of the current EU drone laws 2024 with all the important information that is relevant for drone pilots. Individual sub-areas are also addressed in more detail in separate articles. In this way, we want to keep the article as comprehensive and yet as lean as possible.\n\nPlease note: The information on this page has been compiled to the best of our knowledge and is partly freely translated. Many texts are currently still available as drafts and/or in English. Should there be any changes to the regulations before or after the official launch, we will of course update this page.\n\n## New EU Drone Regulation 2024 \u2013 what has changed?\n\nWith the introduction of the EU Drone Regulation at the end of 2020, the laws surrounding unmanned air traffic were standardized within the EU \u2013 as far as possible. This inevitably led to deviations in the drone regulation from 2017 that was valid in Germany until then.\n\n* Increase of the maximum flight altitude from 100m to 120m\n* Adjustment of weight limits\n* Registration of drone pilots\n* Introduction of two different drone pilot certificates (EU certificate of competence and EU remote pilot certificate\n* eID for drones\n\nThe EU Drone Regulation is additionally structured as follows:\n\n* Classification of drones into classes (C0 \u2013 C5)\n* Classification into application scenarios (Open, Specific, Certified)\n\nThe following paragraphs describe the above points in detail.\n\n## Application scenarios of the EU Drone Regulation 2024\n\nEach drone flight is classified into one of three categories based on its characteristics: Open, Specific and Certified. The Open category is further subdivided into three subcategories A1, A2 and A3. If a drone flight cannot be assigned to any subcategory of the Open category, it automatically slips into the Specific category. If the application is not covered there either, the highest classification is reached, the Certified class.\n\nFor most hobby pilots, the Open category will apply most often, while commercial drone pilots will have to distinguish between Open and Specific. The Certified category will play little role for most drone pilots and will likely apply mostly only to industrial companies such as drone delivery services and similar businesses.\n\n## Use Case Scenario: Open\n\n* No permits necessary\n* Compulsory insurance for all drone pilots\n* Low risk drone flights\n* Flight only allowed within visual range\n* No transport of dangerous goods\n* No dropping of objects\n* Depending on subcategory/drone class Online training\u2026\n* \u2026drone pilot license\u2026\n* \u2026or registration of the drone pilot necessary\n* Minimum age may be chosen by each member state. In Germany it is 16 years, except for toy drones according to directive 2009/48/EC (drones under 250g without camera or sensors for recording) for which there is no age classification\n* A drone license plate with EU registration number (eID) of the drone pilot is required. Except for toy drones (drones under 250g and without recording function).\n* In addition, there are regulations of the respective EU member state. For example, they themselves may define so-called \u201cNo Fly Zones\u201d (no-fly zones) or certain additional restrictions, which must also be adhered to. This usually concerns airfields, military installations, prisons, government buildings and in Germany probably also residential areas (flight only with the consent of the property owner should remain, for example), see section \u201cNo Fly Zones\u201d in the article on the \u201cold\u201d drone regulation).\n* In Germany, these zones are being discussed in a current draft law and should find their way into the German Air Traffic Regulations (LuftVO) in the course of 2021. Until then, the points of the old drone ordinance will still apply, unless they deviate from the points of the EU drone ordinance mentioned in this article. In that case, the laws of the new regulation already apply.\n* Further restrictions additionally result from the drone class (C0-C4). More on this below.\n\n### Subcategory A1\n\n* Flight over people possible (depending on the C classification of the drone).\n* Overflight of uninvolved third parties must be avoided\n* No overflight over crowds of people\n\n### Subcategory A2\n\n* Flight at a safe distance from uninvolved persons (at least 30m).\n* For drones that have a \u201cSlow\u201d mode, the distance can be reduced to 5m\n\n### Subcategory A3\n\n* Flight only at a great distance from people\n* no uninvolved third parties in the entire flight area\n* minimum distance to residential, industrial and commercial areas of at least 150m\n\n### Overview graphic\n\nThe following graphic provides a coherent overview of the requirements for the Open application scenario, its subcategories A1, A2 and A3, ando the drone risk classes C0-C4 presented further below.\n\n## Use Case Scenario: Specific\n\nIf the planned drone flight does not meet one or more of the criteria listed in the Open category, it automatically slips into the Specific category. In this case, a separate SORA-GER risk assessment is required for the operation. This must be submitted to the authority in order to obtain an exemption for the planned flight.\n\nAlternatively, so-called standard scenarios can be used, which make a corresponding SORA-GER assessment superfluous and should simplify the approval process. Two standard scenarios are known to us so far:\n\n* STS-01 \u2013 VLOS (Visual Line of Sight) over a controlled area on the ground in a populated area.\n* STS-02 \u2013 BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line of Sight) over a controlled area on the ground in a sparsely populated area with airspace observer\n\nAuthorities are free to create further standard scenarios themselves. As soon as we receive more information, we will update this section.\n\nWith a LUC certificate (light UAS operator certificate), the application for authorization can be reduced to a one-time application. However, the cost and effort of a LUC certificate is not yet foreseeable. It is equivalent to a comprehensive certification of the drone pilot or the operation itself and will therefore be neither cheap nor quick to obtain.\n\n## Use Case Scenario: Certified (Certified)\n\n* Extensive approval procedures\n* Use cases: Overflight of crowds, transport of people or loads, transport of dangerous goods.\n* Not relevant for hobby pilots as well as for commercial drone pilots from the field of aerial photography\n\n## Drone classes C0-C4 of the EU Drone Regulation 2024\n\nIn the future, drones will be divided into five different risk classes marked C0 to C4. The class of a drone will be decisive for the category in which it can be flown and the requirements that are placed on the drone pilot.\n\nThe classification into a class is carried out by the manufacturer of the drone itself on the basis of established guidelines. The label will then be available to view before a drone is purchased.\n\nCurrently, there are only a handful of drones with appropriate C designations. Therefore, most current drones that will have to do without a C-label will fall into a special category and be listed as so-called inventory drones (more on this below, \u201cTransition phase for existing drones\u201d).\n\nIn this way, drones already on the market should be able to be used without any problems even with the new EU drone regulation. The following paragraphs provide an overview of the respective classes C0-C4. More details can be found in our separate article on the EU drone classes.\n\n### Drone class C0\n\nThe following drones included:\n\n* Weight of the drone is less than 250 grams (also for homebuilt drones).\n* Self-built drone over 250 grams falls under class C3 or C4\n\nSpecifications for the manufacturer/drone\n\n* The drone must not fly faster than 19 m/s (68 km/h)\n* Maximum flight altitude must be adjustable\n\nRegulations for this class\n\n* Drone pilot must read instruction manual\n* Drone pilot must register if there is a camera on the drone (in this case, it is also necessary to attach the license plate with the registration number of the drone pilot)\n* no EU drone license/EU proof of competence is necessary\n* It is allowed to fly in all subcategories of the Open application scenario, i.e. also over people (no crowds)\n\n### Drone class C1\n\nThe following drones included\n\n* Weight of the drone is less than 900 grams or the kinetic energy is less than 80 joules\n\nSpecifications for the manufacturer/drone\n\n* The drone must not fly faster than 19 m/s (68 km/h)\n* Maximum flight altitude must be adjustable\n* Return-to-home function must be available\n* Electronic identification (eID) is required\n* GEO awareness system (automatic flight restriction monitoring) is required\n\nRegulations for this class\n\n* Drone pilot must read instruction manual\n* Drone pilot must have EU certificate of competence (online training and online test), also known as \u201csmall EU drone license\u201d\n* Drone pilot must register and affix a drone license plate/badge with registration number to the drone\n* Flights from subcategory A1 in the Open application scenario possible (but no flight over people)\n\n### Drone class C2\n\nThe following drones included\n\n* Weight of the drone is less than 4 kilograms\n\nSpecifications for the manufacturer/drone\n\n* Maximum flight altitude must be adjustable\n* Return-to-home function must be available\n* Low-speed mode must be available\n* Electronic identification (eID) is required\n* GEO awareness system (automatic flight restriction monitoring) is required\n\nRegulations for this class\n\n* Drone pilot must read instruction manual\n* Drone pilot must have EU certificate of competence (online training and online test), also known as \u201csmall EU drone license\u201d\n* Drone pilot must register and affix a drone license plate/badge with registration number to the drone\n* For flights in subcategory A2 of the Open application scenario, the drone pilot must pass a theoretical test at a recognized testing center (EU remote pilot certificate or also known as \u201clarge drone driver\u2019s license\u201d)\n* A minimum distance of 30 meters from people must be maintained (subcategory A2)\n* However, when low-speed mode is activated (max. 3 m/s), the 1:1 rule applies in terms of altitude and distance to people. This means that at a flight altitude of 10m, you may fly up to 10m away from people. However, the distance must never be less than 5m.\n* Flights also possible in subcategory A3 of the application scenario Open\n\n### Drone class C3 and C4\n\nThe following drones included\n\n* Weight of the drone is less than 25 kilograms or drone is a homemade with more than 250 grams\n\nSpecifications for the manufacturer/drone\n\n* Maximum flight altitude must be adjustable\n* Return-to-home function must be available\n* Electronic identification (eID) is required\n* GEO awareness system (automatic flight restriction monitoring) is required\n* No autonomous flight allowed (class C4)\n\nRegulations for this class\n\n* Drone pilot must read instruction manual\n* Drone pilot must have EU certificate of competence (online training and online test), also known as \u201csmall EU drone license\u201d\n* Drone pilot must register and affix a drone license plate/badge with registration number to the drone\n* Flight only possible in subcategory A3 of the Open application scenario. So it is only allowed to fly outside of cities and only where no uninvolved persons can be endangered.\n\nSource: easa.europa.eu \u2013 [(EU) 2019/945](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019R0945)\n\n### Transition phase for existing drones\n\nSince there are only a few drones with the new C classification so far (as of July 2023), a transitional arrangement exists for most drones on the market (drones manufactured before Jan. 1, 2024, that do not have a C label).\n\nThe drones are allocated depending on their weight and corresponding restrictions are imposed. These can be found in summary in the list below. These drones can be flown without a C-label until Dec. 31, 2023 (validity of the transitional arrangement) depending on their weight in all subcategories of Open (A1 \u2013 A3, see list below).\n\nIt is officially called limited Open category by EASA.\n\n**Existing drones without C-classification (until 31.12.2023)**\n\n* Here, too, insurance is mandatory for all drones\n* Drone pilot must read operating instructions\n\n**Drones under 500g**\n\n* Flight possible in all subcategories (A1, A2, A3) of the Open application scenario\n* No EU drone license required (neither EU certificate of competence nor EU remote pilot certificate).\n* From 01.01.2024: EU certificate of competence required for operation of drones over 250g and under 500g in subcategory A1.\n\n**Drones from 500g and under 2kg**\n\n* Flight in subcategory A2 and A3 of the application scenario Open possible.\n* EU proficiency certificate (small EU drone license) for A3 and \u2026\n* EU remote pilot certificate (large EU drone license) required for operation in subcategory A2. Here, however, with increased distance to people (50m instead of 30m as for drones with C classification).\n* Note: Thanks to transitional regulation until 31.12.2023 also 30m for existing drones.\n\n**Drones from 2kg and under 25kg**\n\n* Flight in subcategory A3 of the application scenario Open possible\n* EU certificate of competence (small EU drone license) required for flights in subcategory A3\n\nFrom 01.01.2024, drones without C classification can be flown in A1 if the weight is below 250g (no EU drone license required) and in A3 (EU proof of competence required) if the weight is below 25kg.\n\nFlights in the A2 subcategory would therefore no longer be possible with existing drones weighing more than 250g. ([EASA FAQ](https://www.easa.europa.eu/faq/116508))\n\n## Insurance obligation\n\nRegardless of any new regulations and whether flying is private or commercial, drone insurance is always mandatory in Germany. This is already the case with the existing drone regulation.\n\nWe have summarized all information on drone liability insurance in the linked article. Our recommendation here is the favorable insurance coverage from [helden.de (ab 39\u20ac/Jahr)](https://helden.de/drohnenhaftpflicht/?src=dhpt&presetVoucher=DHPT4&utm_source=ner&utm_medium=li&utm_campaign=de.po.ro.sa)\\*.\n\n## Drone pilot registration\n\nThe online registration application for drone owners is available online. We have compiled important information on this in a corresponding news item.\n\nWe have summarized all information on registration and marking according to the current EU Drone Regulation in the following article: [**Registrierung und Kennzeichnung \u2013 eID \u2013 EU-Drohnenverordnung**](https://www.skyzr.com/registrierung-und-kennzeichnung-eid-eu-drohnenverordnung/)\n\n## EU Drone Operator Licenses of the EU Drone Regulation 2024\n\nAs mentioned several times above, the new EU Drone Regulation also introduces two new \u201cdrone operator licenses\u201d.\n\n* EU certificate of competence (\u201csmall EU drone pilot\u2019s license\u201d)\n* EU Remote Pilot Certificate (\u201clarge EU drone pilot\u2019s license\u201d)\n\nBoth \u201cdriving licenses\u201d will become mandatory as of 01.01.2021 in the respective required subcategory and C-classification (see notes above).\n\n### EU proof of competence\n\n* Online training\n* Online test\n* may be repeated as often as desired\n* probably free of charge and can be done online directly at the LBA\n* Validity: 5 years\n\n### EU Remote Pilot Certificate\n\n* EU proof of competence is a prerequisite\n* Practical self-training required (own written confirmation sufficient)\n* Theory test at a certified testing center required, usually in combination with a training course\n* Validity: 5 years\n* Fee-based, as carried out by external and certified providers\n\nIt is very likely that the official examining bodies that have been offering the proficiency test up to now will gradually switch over to the EU Remote Pilot Certificate as well.\n\nWe have summarized everything else that is important about EU drone licenses for you in our article EU Drone License \u2013 All Information.\n\n### What happens to an old issued certificate of knowledge?\n\nSo far, it is planned to keep the current drone knowledge certificates valid until the end of 2021. After that, they can be converted into the small EU drone license (i.e. EU certificate of competence).\n\nMore information will follow in a separate article.\n\n## Sources on the EU Drone Regulation\n\nThe official source for the EU Drone Regulation is EASA (European Union Aviation Safety Agency). Here you can find all official documents, draft laws and further information. The entire site is in English. Some documents are available in different languages. Particularly relevant here are the regulations [(EU) 2019/945](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32019R0945&from=EN) as well as [(EU) 2019/947](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32019R0947).\n\nThe Luftfahrt Bundesamt (LBA) [offers a short FAQ on the new EU drone regulation (german)](https://www.lba.de/DE/Drohnen/Allgemeine_Informationen/Allgemeine_Informationen_node.html), which we also used as a source for our article.\n\n## EU Drone Regulation 2024 FAQ\n\n**Since when is the current EU Drone Regulation 2024 in force?**\n\nThe current EU Drone Regulation 2024 has already been in force since 01.01.2021. Our detailed article provides all information on the current EU regulations.\n\n**Do I need drone insurance according to the EU Drone Regulation 2024?**\n\nYes, with the current EU Drone Regulation 2024, drone liability insurance is always mandatory. You are not allowed to fly without it.\n\n**Do I have to register as a drone pilot?**\n\nUnder the current EU Drone Regulation 2024, it may be mandatory to officially register as a drone pilot with the LBA. This depends on the risk class (C0-C4) of the drone used. We have summarized all the information in this article on the EU Drone Regulation.\n\n**What changes will the new EU Drone Regulation 2024 bring?**\n\nWith the current EU Drone Regulation, there have been numerous changes in the operation of drones. You can read all about the application scenarios and the new drone risk classes in our article on the EU Drone Regulation 2024.\n\n**Can I continue to use my existing certificate of knowledge?**\n\nThe German certificate of proficiency was valid until the end of 2021. It could be rewritten into the new EU certificate of competence (small EU drone license). More info can be found in the article.\n\n**What is the EU drone license?**\n\nWith the EU Drone Regulation 2024, there are two drone licenses: the small (EU Certificate of Competence) and the large (EU Remote Pilot Certificate). Depending on the drone risk class, one of the two may be necessary.

The **European Union Aviation Safety Agency** (EASA) is putting in place comprehensive regulations, effective January 1, 2024 to ensure Europe is in the forefront of drone use and pave the way for future use-cases and extensive drone use across all fields of application. Let's explore what these particular changes are, and what they mean for drone operators.\u00a0Drones are classified into open, specific, and certified categories, each with unique operational limitations and compliance requirements. For instance, the open category caters to lower-risk activities, while the certified category addresses high-risk operations.\n\n\u200d\n\n#### **C Classifications**\u200d\n\nFrom January 1st, 2024, new drones placed on the market must have a C classification marking to be used in the open category. Existing drones can still be used under certain conditions. [***Read the information on\u00a0EASA\u00a0website here.***](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones) A quick summary is:\n\n1. Drones under 250 g can be flown in subcategory A1.\n2. Drones under 25 kg can be flown in subcategory A3.\n3. Drones weighing 250 g or more require the completion of the A1/A3 online theoretical examination.\n4. Flying in subcategory A2 is only possible with a C2-class drone\u200b\u200b.\n\n\u200d\n\n#### There are seven C classifications for drones:\n\n1. C0 and C1 are for the open subcategory A1.\n2. C2 is for the open subcategory A2.\n3. C2, C3, and C4 are for the open subcategory A3.\n4. C5 and C6 are for operations that require an operating permit and are subject to a fee\u200b\u200b.\n\n\u200d\n\n#### **Mandatory Registration and Identification**\u200d\n\nA critical aspect of these regulations is that Remote Identification for Drones will become mandatory starting Januari 1st, 2024, enhancing airspace safety and accountability across the EU.[***Read the information on\u00a0EASA\u00a0website here.***](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/general-publications/remote-identification-will-become-mandatory-drones-across)\n\n\u200d\n\n#### **Operational Authorization and Stringent Standards**\u200d\n\nOperations under the specific category require authorization from National Aviation Authorities, including operations beyond visual line of sight and those involving heavier drones.\n\nRead and understand all regulations at the official [***EASA Civil Drones Page***](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones)***.***\n\n\u200d\n\n### **Globhe: Paving the Way for Compliance and Efficiency**\n\n**\u200d**Navigating these regulations might seem challenging, but Globhe simplifies the process.

It defines the conditions the operator must observe when conduct all flights in the operation:\n\n#### Where to apply?\n\nThe applicant needs to apply to the [National Aviation Authority (NAA)](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones/naa) in the state where he/she is registered as an operator.\n\n#### What is to be provided in the application for the operational authorisation?\n\nA duly filled [application form](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/downloads/137214/en), a copy of the Operations Manual (OM) (please check the [EASA Operations Manual example for UAS operations at SAIL II](/en/document-library/general-publications/easa-operations-manual-example-uas-operations-sail-ii)) and of the compliance evidence document whose content varies depending on the risk of operation. For example, for low risk operations, the documents may be very small and simple.\u00a0The OM ([example for SAIL II UAS operations](/en/document-library/general-publications/easa-operations-manual-example-uas-operations-sail-ii)) should contain all information that the staff of the operator should know in order to ensure the safety of the operation. It contains a detailed description of the intended operations, as well as an insight of the organisation\u2019s culture and the operating procedures.\n\n#### Operational authorisation with a [PDRA](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-rpas/specific-category-civil-drones/predefined-risk-assessment-pdra)\n\nIf the operation you intend to conduct is covered by one of the published [PDRAs](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-rpas/specific-category-civil-drones/predefined-risk-assessment-pdra) you need to submit to the NAA a copy of the:\n\n![Apply for authorisation](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Apply%20for%20authorisation.png)\n\n![Apply for authorisation](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Apply%20for%20authorisation.png)\n\nThe PDRA table helps you to develop the operator manual that should contain all information that a staff of the operator should know in order to ensure the safety of the operation. It contains a detailed description of the intended operations, as well as an insight of the organization\u2019s culture and the operating procedures.\n\n#### Operational authorisation without a PDRA\n\nIf the operation intended to be conducted is not covered by any PDRA you need to firstly carry out a specific risk assessment. [Regulation (EU) 2019/947](/en/document-library/regulations/commission-implementing-regulation-eu-2019947) proposes the [SORA (specific operational risk assessment)](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-rpas/specific-category-civil-drones/specific-operations-risk-assessment-sora) methodology to be used for this purpose. You can find the SORA As the AMC 1 to Article 11 of Regulation (EU) 2019/947.\n\nThis methodology helps to identify the risk level of the operation and also to identify the mitigations and operational safety objectives needed to make the operation safe. When the drone operator believes to have properly classified the operation he/she should contact the [National Aviation Authority (NAA)](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones/naa) to apply for an operational authorization and have the NAA to review the risk assessment.\n\n![Pic4](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Picture4_0.png)\n\n![Pic4](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Picture4_0.png)\n\nThen the drone operator should demonstrate compliance with all mitigations and safety objectives to be ready for completing the application.\n\n![pic5](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Picture5_0.png)\n\n![pic5](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Picture5_0.png)\n\n*The main requirements of this risk assessment can be found in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) 2019/947.*  \n  \nAt this moment the UAS operator needs to submit to the NAA a copy of:\n\n![Apply for authorisation](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Apply%20for%20authorisation_0.png)\n\n![Apply for authorisation](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Apply%20for%20authorisation_0.png)\n\n#### Authorising an operational application\n\n(Article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2019/947)  \nThe NAA will issue an operational authorisation, when it considers that the risks are adequately mitigated. Then it will provide the drone operator with the [operational authorisation](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/downloads/137214/en) as soon as possible, and the operation can then start. See below If you want to operate in a state different from the state of registration.\n\n#### Validity of an authorisation\n\nThe operational authorisation will be valid in all EASA member state for all flights conducted within the limitations and duration defined in the authorisation. However, the NAA may impose a limitation in time and/or number of flights.\u00a0  \nOperation in a state different from the state of registration (Article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2019/947) please see the [dedicated page](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-rpas/specific-category-civil-drones/operations-specific-category-state-different-one-registration).\n\n#### Drone authorisation process with an NAA\n\nAs a drone operator in the EASA Member States it is important to get an authorisation from the [National Aviation Authority (NAA)](/domains/civil-drones/naa) of the country in which your organisation is based.\n\nOperational authorisations are needed to start a drone operation in the specific category. An authorisation is not needed if the operation is covered by a Standard Scenario or you already have a Light UAS operator certificate - LUC with the appropriate privileges.\n\nThe authorization process involves submitting an application to the NAA and includes an assessment of the risk of the intended operations, the provision of the organisation\u2019s Operations Manual (OM) and the required evidence to show compliance with the applicable requirements. It is also necessary to demonstrate competence as a drone operator and evidence of training, certifications and experience will be required to demonstrate your ability to conduct operations safely and responsibly.\n\nThe National Aviation Authorities will evaluate the applications and grant authorizations. They review your application, and ensure your operations comply with the regulatory requirements. Effective communication and collaboration with the NAA is vital throughout the authorization process. Respond promptly to any requests for additional information, provide accurate details to ensure a smooth process.\u00a0 The timeline for authorization may vary depending on the complexity of your operations and the workload of the Authority. It is advisable to submit your application well in advance to allow sufficient time for processing.\n\nObtaining an authorization demonstrates your compliance with the applicable requirements and it allows you to conduct specific category operations. These requirements are proportionate to risk level of your operation.\n\nThe authorisation is issued once the operator has shown compliance with the applicable requirements of the European Drone Rules in Regulation (EU) 2019/947, which is applicable since 31 December 2020. More information can be found on the [operating a drone](/operating-drone) page. This harmonizes the rules for drone operations across the European Union, including Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein \u2013 [the EASA Member States](/domains/drones-air-mobility/topics/easa-member-states). Once you receive your authorisation, this means you can use it to operate your drone in all these countries.\n\nIn summary, contact the NAA in the EASA country where you are based. They will then guide your through the full process and inform you on what authorisations and permits you need for your type of activity.\n\nFor additional information please [contact the team](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/contact-us-aviation?select=Aviation&aviation=Drones).\n\n##### [**EASA Website create account**](/user/register)**Stay informed on** Operational authorisation**:**\n\n![EASA Website create account](/sites/default/files/inline-images/easa-website-follow-create-account.png)\n\n### Downloads\n\n#### [Form for Application for an operational authorisation for the \u2018specific\u2019 category](/en/downloads/138404/en \"form_for_application_for_an_operational_authorisation.pdf\")\n\n#### [Form for Operational authorisation for the \u2018specific\u2019 category](/en/downloads/138405/en \"form_for_operational_authorisation.pdf\")\n\n#### [EASA Operations Manual example for UAS operations at SAIL II](/en/downloads/138411/en \"easa_operations_manual_example_for_uas_operations_in_sail_ii_1.docx\")\n\n### Related Content\n\n### [Easy Access Rules for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (Regulations (EU) 2019/947 and 2019/945)](/en/document-library/easy-access-rules/easy-access-rules-unmanned-aircraft-systems-regulations-eu)\n\n### [Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/947](/en/document-library/regulations/commission-implementing-regulation-eu-2019947)\n\n## ONLINE SERVICES\n\n## READ MORE\n\n## WEBSITE\n\n## CONNECT WITH US\n\n## CAN WE HELP YOU?\n\n![EU](/themes/custom/easa_foundation/images/eu_flag_small.png)",

To assess these risk levels, [EASA](https://www.easa.europa.eu) has created several flight categories **(Open, Specific)** which require the use of standardized drones that have received a class indication **(C0-C6)**.\n\n#### [Drone Open & Specific Summary for 2024](#1)\n\n[E](#2)\n\n#### [What is the open category?](#2)\n\n[E](#3)\n\n#### [What is the Specific category?](#3)\n\n[E](#4)\n\n#### [What are standard scenarios (STS)?](#4)\n\n[E](#5)\n\n#### [How to convert your drone into a C5 class ?](#5)\n\n[E](#6)\n\n#### [How do I fly outside STS scenarios in a specific category?](#6)\n\n[E](#7)\n\n#### [What is a PDRA (Pre-Defined Risk Assessment)?](#7)\n\n[E](#8)\n\n#### [What is a SORA (Specific Operations Risk Assessment)?](#8)\n\n[E](#9)\n\n#### [What is IGRC (Intrisinc Ground Risk Class) ?](#9)\n\n[E](#10)\n\n#### [What is Final GRC (Final Ground Risk Class) ?](#10)\n\n[E](#11)\n\n#### [What are MOC (Mean Of Compliance) ?](#11)\n\n[E](#12)\n\n#### [How to reduce Final GRC with MOC2512 (M2)?](#12)\n\n[E](#13)\n\n#### [How to complete part 8 with MOC2511 ?](#13)\n\n[E](#14)\n\n#### [What is a LUC (Light UAS Operator Certificate)?](#14)\n\n## Drone Open & Specific Summary for 2024\n\n**You\u2019re not sure you can fly your drone? You don\u2019t know which regulatory category it falls into?** Understanding the different flight categories and classifications is essential for professional drone pilots.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019re going to analyse the Open and Specific categories for you, clarifying their operational parameters and all the restrictions associated with them. Nevertheless, it\u2019s important to remember that airspace management is the responsibility of each European Member State, as is the establishment of airspace zones and the requirements for flying in them.\n\n## What is the open category?\n\nThe Open Category encompasses drone operations with minimal risk to individuals, property, and other aircraft. Primarily designed for recreational drone pilots, it comprises three subcategories\u2014**A1**, **A2**, and **A3**\u2014each adapted to various drone types and operational scenarios. Common to all subcategories are strict regulations, including:\n\n* **Prohibitions on flying over groups of uninvolved individuals**\n* **A maximum flight altitude of 120 meters above ground**\n* **The requirement for visual line of sight.**\n\n### SUBCATEGORY **A1**\n\nThe Open Category\u2019s A1 subcategory permits flying over uninvolved people, exclusively designated for drones equipped with identification tags C0 or C1. These drones posses a low-risk profile, although stringent precautions are still essential to mitigate potential incidents. A1-eligible drones must weigh a maximum of 900 grams and adhere to a maximum speed of 19m/s or 68 km/h.\n\n**C0 drones**, with a maximum weight of 250g, are allowed in both A1 and A3 categories, permitting flights over uninvolved individuals and within urban areas.\n\n**C1 drones**, with a maximum weight of 900g, are only permitted in A1 and A3 operations within urban areas, with the caveat that intentional flights over uninvolved individuals are strictly prohibited. Operations within the A1 category can fly close to or even above people with very light drones but are strictly prohibited from flying over groups of people.\n\n**C0 & C1 certified drones list** (not exhaustive)**:**\n\n* DJI Mini 2 SE / 3 / 3 Pro / 4 Pro **(C0)**\n* DJI Mavic 3 Classic **(C1)**\n* DJI Mavic 3 v2.0 **(C1)**\n* DJI Mavic 3 Cine v2.0 **(C1)**\n* DJI Air 3 **(C1)**\n\n## SUBCATEGORY **A2**\n\nSubcategory A2 within the Open Category imposes stricter requirements compared to A1. It permits flights with drones weighing up to 4 kilograms and includes prohibitions over sensitive sites, along with the necessity to maintain minimum safety distances from people and residential areas. Drone pilots operating within this category are mandated to fly within 30 meters of people or 5 meters if the low-speed mode is activated.\n\nIn addition to these regulations, A2 operations are exclusively designated for drones equipped with a label **C2**. Flying close to third parties is allowed in A2, with required horizontal distances set at 30 meters or flight altitude, or 5 meters when in low-speed mode.\n\n**C2 drones**, with a maximum weight of 4kg, are permitted in both A2 and A3 categories, enabling flights close to uninvolved people and within urban areas.\n\n**C2\u00a0certified drones list** (not exhaustive)**:**\n\n* DJI Mavic 3 Enterprise\n* DJI Mavic 3 Multispectral\n* DJI Mavic 3 Thermal\n* DJI Matrice M30 / Matrice M30T\n* AgEagle Sensefly eBee\n\n### SUBCATEGORY **A3**\n\nDesigned for higher-risk operations, Subcategory A3 permits drone flights with a take-off mass of up to 25 kilograms. Flying near people and vehicles is strictly prohibited, with a minimum safety distance of 150 meters required from unconcerned people.\n\nIn addition to these regulations, A3 operations are designated exclusively for drones equipped with C class labels C2, C3 and C4.\n\n**C3 & C4** drones are allowed only in A3 category flights, with a maximum weight of 25kg, and must maintain a minimum distance of 150 meters from urban areas and uninvolved individuals, including residential, commercial, industrial, and recreational areas.\n\n**C3\u00a0certified drones list** (not exhaustive)**:**\n\n* DJI Inspire 3\n* DJI M350 RTK\n* Quantum Trinity F90+\n* WingtraOne\n* Delair UX11 / UX11 Longue\n\n## What is the SPECIFIC category?\n\nThe EASA has established the Specific Category to regulate drone operations with higher levels of risk or complexity compared to those in the Open category. To operate within this category, there are four ways to obtain approval:\n\n**1.** Submission of a declaration according to **European Standard Scenarios (STS-01 / STS-02)**\n\n**2.** Obtaining a permit for a specific type of flight by submitting a **Pre-Defined Risk Assessment (PDRA)**\n\n**3.** Obtaining authorization for a specific type of flight by submitting a **Specific Operations Risk Assessment (SORA)**\n\n**4.** Obtaining a **Light UAS Operator Certificate (LUC)**\n\n[EASA - Operational Authorisation](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-rpas/specific-category-civil-drones/operational-authorisation)\n\n## What are standard scenarios (STS)?\n\nA standard scenario represents a pre-established operation, providing pilots different possibilities for their flights. Operators are not obligated to obtain operational authorization for STS operations. Therefore, it is essential to first determine if the operation can be accommodated under an STS.\n\nThere are two types of scenarios: **STS-01** and **STS-02**. The choice of scenario depends on the environment and type of missions in which you will operate your drone: urban areas, visual line of sight flights, beyond visual line of sight flights, controlled zones, etc.\n\nCommon features of flights under STS regulations include:\n\n* **Daytime flights are permitted, while night flights are strictly prohibited.**\n* **Drones with a wingspan less than 3 meters have the possibility to fly above controlled areas on the ground, whether in Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) or Visual Line of Sight (VLOS).**\n* **For drones with a wingspan less than 1 meter, flying over assemblies of people in VLOS is allowed, and BVLOS flights are possible above sparsely populated areas.**\n* **All flights are limited to a maximum height of 120 meters.**\n\n#### **STS-01** SCENARIO\n\nDesigned for operations with a low to medium level of risk, STS01 mandates the utilization of drones classified as **C5** class. These drones must adhere to a maximum speed of 5 m/s and maintain Visual Line of Sight (VLOS) during flight. Essentially, drones operating under STS01 regulations must stay within 120 meters from the ground, adjusted for terrain, and should not carry risky materials.\n\nAdditionally, the flight zone must be controlled on the ground if in a populated area. When flying near tall artificial obstacles, the maximum height can increase by up to 15 meters with permission.\n\nTo ensure compliance with STS01 regulations, drones must have the C5 class. Some C2/C3 drones (DJI Mavic 3, Inspire 3, Matrice 350) **may need to be upgraded using certified accessory/conversion kits that include a Flight Termination System (FTS) and a Parachute Recovery System (PRS).**\n\n### how to convert your drone into a C5 class ?\n\nIf your drone is a C2 model, you have the option to upgrade it to a C5 classification using a conversion kit. On the other hand, if it\u2019s a C3 model, you can achieve the C5 status with the use of an accessory kit.\n\nUsing Dronavia\u2019s conversion kit:\n\n* DJI Mavic 3 Enterprise **(C2)** = [Kronos AD Mavic 3E](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-dji-mavic-3/) **(C5)**\n* DJI Mavic 3 Thermal **(C2)** = Kronos AD Mavic 3T (C5)\n* DJI Mavic 3 Multispectral **(C2)** = Kronos AD Mavic 3M **(C5)**\n* DJI Mavic 3 Pro/Cine **(C2)** = Kronos Mavic 3 Pro Cine **(C5)**\n\nWith Dronavia\u2019s accessory kit:\n\n* DJI M350 RTK **(C3)** [is transformed into Matrice 350 RTK](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-dji-matrice-350/) **(C5)**\n* DJI Inspire 3 **(C3)** [is transformed into Inspire 3](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-dji-inspire-3/) **(C5)**\n\n[See the official list of C5 drones](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-rpas/open-category-civil-drones)\n\n#### **STS-02** scenario\n\nReserved for high-risk operations or those conducted in sensitive airspace, STS02 mandates the usage of a **C6** aircraft and comprehensive risk assessments, along with close coordination with air traffic control authorities. Similar to the STS-01 scenario, drones must stay within 120 meters from the ground, adjusting for terrain variations. However, BVLOS flights are only possible in ground-controlled areas and outside populated areas.\n\nFurthermore, drones operating under STS02 regulations must be C6 class and must not carry dangerous goods. A buffer zone, calculated based on the drone\u2019s characteristics and the Flight Termination System (FTS), must be maintained. The maximum flight distance is limited to 1 kilometer, and the drone must remain visible within 5 kilometers.\n\nIn cases where visibility is limited, or there is an absence of an aerial observer, a pre-programmed trajectory must be followed. However, if an aerial observer is present, the maximum flight distance extends to 2 kilometers.\n\n## How do I fly outside STS scenarios in a specific category?\n\nDepending on the risk of the operation to be carried out, the specific category does not offer pre-established requirements adapted to all operations. Each UAS operator must develop its own operational scenarios. This is a fundamental difference from the open category.\n\nThere are several ways of developing your own scenarios **(PDRA / SORA / LUC)** in order to fly outside the STS scenarios, but the methodology used is always that of the SORA. Here we present the SORA methodology and how it applies to these 3 methods.\n\n## what is a PDRA (**Pre-Defined Risk Assessment**)?\n\nIn the first instance, if the STS scenarios are not suitable for your mission, you will not have to resort immediately to a manual application. The intermediate stage is called Pre-Defined Risk Assessment (PDRA).\n\nIt is based on a large number of predefined missions which involve a higher risk than STS missions and which are frequently encountered in everyday life. In summary, PDRAs are pre-configured risk assessments based largely on the SORA methodology.\n\nThese PDRAs, are approved by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) as acceptable means of complying with Regulation 2019/947. We list some of them here:\n\n**PDRA-S: STS for uncertified drones**\n\nIf you want to fly a drone without a CE C5 or C6 class in an STS scenario, you can use a PDRA-S called **PDRA-S01 / PDRA-S02**.\n\n**PDRA-G: model for frequent missions**\n\nPDRA-Gs are structured in the same way as STSs, and differ only in the higher risks associated with the mission. The models that can be used are called **PDRA-G01 / PRDA-G02 / PDRA-G03.**\n\nEASA is already anticipating the future and is now working on the publication of new PDRAs to create new scenarios and facilitate access to them for professional telepilot :\n\n**PDRA-06:** Test operations for drones up to 8 metres, in areas where at least 50% of manned aviation can be detected.\n\n**PDRA-07:** Operations in the airport area to carry out inspections.\n\n**PDRA-08:** Drone swarm operations.\n\n## what is a SORA 2.5 (**Specific Operations Risk Assessment**)?\n\nIf your flight missions still do not correspond to any appropriate STS or PDRA, the SORA (Specific Operations Risk Assessment) solution is the best way to obtain authorisation. The SORA process was developed by an international forum made up of different safety and risk experts. The name of this organization is **JARUS (Joint Authorities for Rulemaking on Unmanned Systems).**\n\nThe SORA 2.5 method produces a value called **SAIL (Specific Assurance Integrity Level)**, which is the result of combining **the ground risk (GRC)**, **the air risk (ARC)** and the corresponding mitigation measures applied. Depending on the SAIL index obtained, the operation will be considered more or less risky:\n\n**Low risk (SAIL I and II)**  \n**Medium risk (SAIL III and IV)**  \n**High risk (SAIL V and VI)**\n\nOnce the risks have been defined, **the SORA 2.5 method indicates the minimum safety requirements that an operator must meet** in order to carry out the mission safely. The cost of developing a SORA application can range from \u20ac5,000 to \u20ac10,000.\n\n## what is the **operations manual (OM)**?\n\nAccording to Regulation (EU) 2019/947 an application for an operational authorisation in the specific category **must include an Operation Manual (OM),** together with the associated specific operations risk assessment (SORA), or a PDRA table if applicable, and the evidences of compliance.\n\nIf the operator\u2019s activity has already been declared (within his country) and he has an Operation Manual (OM) drawn up before 31/12/2020, then it can be considered as an Operation Manual (OM) within the meaning of European legislation. **All you need to do is complete this manual with the new specifics of the new regulation (EU 2019/947).**\n\nAs specialists in the immersive industry, we know that the drone is an essential tool. A well-written Operation Manual ensures safe and efficient flight operations. How to obtain an Operations Manual respecting the regulations in force as well as your operation? **Only one step: Fill out the form above (10 minutes)**\n\nAt the end of this step, we will send you the document and invite you to reread it to fully understand it.

To determine the intrinsic GRC , professional telepilots must take into account appendix F of the SORA 2.5 method, a table which takes into account the dimensions of the UAV, the maximum speed of the UAV and the population density present for the flight operation.\n\nOnce the initial intrinsic GRC has been determined, mitigation measures must be applied to reduce the risk and thus obtain the value of the final GRC.These mitigation measures are as follows:\n\n* There are effective engineered containment systems in place.\n* Systems that reduce the effects of the impact on people on the ground.\n* An effective emergency response plan is in place, available for use and has been validated.\n\n## What is FINAL GRC (**FINAL** **Ground Risk Class**) ?\n\n**FINAL GRC**  \n**(Step #3 of the SORA methodology)**\n\nAccording to this SORA methodology, the robustness of the mitigation measures is defined by the level of integrity offered by each of the mitigation measures and the level of assurance that the mitigation measures have achieved (for example, the method by which it is proven).\n\nThus, we find 3 types of robustness levels:\n\n**Low robustness**  \n**Medium robustness**  \n**High robustness**\n\nThus, depending on the robustness values of the mitigation measures applied, the GRC value can be reduced and the final GRC value obtained, always bearing in mind that it cannot be reduced below the minimum value in the resulting column of the \u201cUAS intrinsic ground risk class index\u201d table.\n\n## WHAT ARE MOC **(MEANS OF COMPLIANCE)** ?\n\nAn MoC (Means of Compliance) is a way for professional drone operators to demonstrate that they comply with the regulations and standards that apply to their activities, and to guarantee the quality and safety of the products they use. To obtain it, it is necessary to meet the current regulatory requirements published by EASA, the European Union\u2019s Aviation Safety Agency.\n\nIn addition to the quality and safety offered by a product that complies with the MOCs proposed by EASA, **professional drone operators can more easily obtain a SORA (Specific Operations Risk Assessment) or a PDRA (Pre-Defined Risk Assessment), flight authorisations issued for complex missions in a specific category.**\n\n\u201cAMCs are non-binding standards adopted by EASA to illustrate means to establish compliance with the Basic Regulation and its Implementing Rules.\n\nThe AMCs issued by EASA are not of a legislative nature. They cannot create additional obligations on the regulated persons, who may decide to show compliance with the applicable requirements using other means. However, as the legislator wanted such material to provide for legal certainty and to contribute to uniform implementation, it provided the AMC adopted by EASA with a presumption of compliance with the rules, so that it commits competent authorities to recognise regulated persons complying with EASA AMC as complying with the law.\u201d\n\n[Definition by EASA](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/acceptable-means-compliance-amcs-and-alternative-means-compliance-altmocs)\n\n### how to REDUCE FINAL GRC with **MOC2512 (M2)**?\n\nAs professional telepilots, it is important to be aware of the means of compliance for M2 mitigations of medium robustness, enabling you to reduce your final GRC score during the SORA application.\n\nMOC2512 (M2) designates the level of robustness required for the safety system in the event of a drone losing control and falling to the ground. To achieve this, the safety system must :\n\nReduce the effect of ground impact  \nOperate reliably in the event of loss of control  \nNot introduce any additional risk\n\nDronavia\u2019s Kronos Parachute Recovery Systems (PRS) for [DJI Inspire 3](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-dji-inspire-3/) and [Matrice 300/350](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-dji-matrice-350/) as well as for [DJI Mavic 3](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-dji-mavic-3/) comply with MOC25-12 (M2) published by the EASA and therefore reduce the final GRC score by one point.\n\n**To benefit from this score reduction, Dronavia is able to provide all the necessary proof (declaration of conformity, test reports, etc.) requested by the national authority and/or the EASA.**\n\n### how to complete part 8 \u00a0 with **MOC2511** ?\n\nStep 8 (Containment Requirements) of the SORA 2.5 discusses the risk of losing control of the aircraft and flying into adjacent areas where the risk to third parties (on the ground or in the air) may be greater. If the aircraft is not adequately designed, there may be probable reasons that could lead to an exit from the area of operation.\n\nThe operator must take into account a matrix which combines the SAIL and the final GRC of the adjacent area, explained in appendix E of the SORA 2.5. For any reinforced containment system, the operator must: \u201cdeclare compliance with the provisions of the document \u201cMeans of compliance with Light UAS.2511 \u2013 Reinforced containment\u201d, or provide proof of this compliance (technical description, test reports, etc.) when applying for a permit. \u201c\n\nThe Dronavia flight termination systems (FTS) of the Kronos range for [DJI Inspire 3](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronons-fts-inspire3/) and [Matrice 300/350](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-fts-matrice350/) as well as for [DJI Mavic 3](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/zephyr-fts-mavic3/) are compliant with MOC25-11 published by EASA and allow compliance with step 8 during the SORA application.\n\n**To benefit from this compliance, Dronavia is able to provide all the necessary evidence (declaration of conformity, test reports, ground risk buffer, etc.) requested by the national authority and/or the EASA.**\n\n## what is a LUC **(Light UAS Operator Certificate)**?\n\nThe latest solution is aimed at all users who have to submit activity reports for a well-defined type of operation on a very regular basis.\n\nLUC stands for Light UAS Operator Certificate and means that you are particularly familiar with the risks and safety measures to be applied for a specific type of drone operation. If you obtain an LUC, you can :\n\n* **Operate in standard scenarios without declaring it**\n* **Operate in PDRA without approval**\n* **Conduct the SORA process and related operations without authorization**\n\n# C5 CLASS\n\nfor your DJI Matrice 350\n\n[more informations](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-dji-matrice-350/)\n\n# C5 CLASS\n\nfor your DJI Inspire 3\n\n[more informations](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-dji-inspire-3/)\n\n# C5 CLASS\n\nfor your DJI Mavic 3\n\n[more informations](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-dji-mavic-3/)\n\nmore articles\n\n## [Procedure for converting a C2/C5 drone: What you need to know](https://www.dronavia.com/2025/12/05/procedure-converting-c2-c5-drone/)\n\nDec 5, 2025\n\nProcedure for converting a C2/C5 drone: What you need to know Many professional pilots are...\n\n## [Kronos MVC3 \u2013 Manufacturer Maintenance Campaign](https://www.dronavia.com/2025/10/03/kronos-mvc3-maintenance/)\n\nOct 3, 2025\n\npress release: Kronos MVC3 manufacturer maintenance campaign Dronavia announces the official...\n\n## [Drone DJI C2 / C5 sur AlphaTango : Processus d\u00e9claratif & contraintes](https://www.dronavia.com/2025/06/02/c2-c5-conversion-kit/)\n\nJun 2, 2025\n\nDRONES DJI : CONVERSION C2/C5 : PROCESSUS D\u00c9CLARATIF ET CONTRAINTES \u00a0De nombreux pilotes...\n\n## [Dronavia & DJI: a long story](https://www.dronavia.com/2025/01/07/dronavia-dji-a-long-story/)\n\nJan 7, 2025\n\nDronavia & DJI: a long story Dronavia has officially joined the DJI Eco Partner ecosystem, an...\n\n## [Dronavia officially becomes DJI Eco Partner](https://www.dronavia.com/2025/01/07/dji-eco-partner/)\n\nJan 7, 2025\n\ndronavia officially becomes a DJI Eco Partner Dronavia is proud to announce its official...\n\n## [INTERVIEW \uff5cThe very first STS-01 (EASA) telepilot in Austria](https://www.dronavia.com/2024/09/19/first-sts-01-telepilot/)\n\nSep 19, 2024\n\nThe very first STS-01 telepilot in Austria: The interview Raffel Portugal was lucky enough to...\n\n## [How can I update my Fly ID system from my web interface?](https://www.dronavia.com/2024/06/06/update-fly-id-system/)\n\nJun 6, 2024\n\nFly ID update available: Get remote dual identification (FR/EU) How can I update my Fly ID system...\n\n## [Remote dual identification (FR/EU) : Understanding everything](https://www.dronavia.com/2024/05/14/double-identification/)\n\nMay 14, 2024\n\nFly ID and Zephyr Beacon update available: Get remote dual identification (FR/EU)UPDATE FLY ID /...\n\n## [European exclusivity : Get C5 class for DJI Mavic 3 drone](https://www.dronavia.com/2024/04/11/c5-class-for-dji-mavic-3-enterprise-pro/)\n\nApr 11, 2024\n\nEUROPEAN EXCLUSIVITY : GET C5 CLASS FOR DJI MAVIC 3 (ENTERPRISE/PRO/PRO CINE) Dronavia is proud to...\n\nShare This\n\n ",

Whether you\u2019re a hobbyist, commercial operator, or policymaker, staying informed on current and emerging drone laws is crucial. With developments in autonomous flight, AI-powered operations, and real-time data, updated policies are essential for legal compliance and operational success.\n\nIn this article, we will break down drone legislation, from existing practices to new updates, and what to expect in the following years. The article will also cover drone laws and policies, compliance tips, global regulations, and the vital question: What are the current drone laws? It is already half of the year, yet staying informed has never been more critical.\n\n## Why Understanding Drone Laws Is Essential in 2025\n\nLike any other aerial operation, deploying a drone comes with a legal responsibility. Now that more industries are relying on drone operations in their everyday work, adhering to the rules and regulations is a must.\n\nSo, whether you are a professional drone pilot, a hobbyist, or a drone manufacturer, here are some of the reasons why staying updated is crucial:\n\n* Practice legal and proper drone flights to avoid penalties and airspace violations.\n* Securing everyone\u2019s privacy and maintaining public trust.\n* Building a drone business\u2019s credibility by complying with drone regulations.\n* Availability for international operations with enough knowledge of global drone laws.\n* Creating and adapting to new frameworks and drone law updates.\n* Learning the essentials as governments worldwide are tightening national drone laws.\n\nHaving sufficient knowledge and awareness of drone laws worldwide enables operators and companies to adjust their drones and flights, thereby reducing risks and future concerns.\n\n## **Current Landscape of Drone Laws (2023\u20132024 Overview)**\n\nUnderstanding the evolution of drone laws from 2023 to 2024 provides insight into the current rules and regulations. So, what were these policies in the past years? Here are some of the following, in the:\n\n**Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the United States:**\n\n* They were able to enforce a remote ID rule for drone identification.\n* They strengthened their [BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line of Sight)](https://www.zenatech.com/drone-laws-2025-everything-you-need-to-know/) rules and pilot programs.\n* They implement a regulation requiring drones over 250 grams to be registered.\n* They also require that the commercial operators have a Part 107 certification.\n\n**European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA):**\n\n* They presented U-Space regulations for handling urban drone traffic.\n* They also updated SORA (Specific Operations Risk Assessment) to version 2.5.\n* The union also introduced certified pathways for drones that weigh up to 600 kg.\n\n**Transport Canada:**\n\n* They divided their drone operations into basic and advanced categories.\n* They also required registering drones that weigh between 250 grams and 25 kg.\n* They implement a Mandated Special Flight Operations Certificate for complex drone missions.\n\nThese are just some of the drone regulation updates; these may vary depending on the countries and their national laws.\n\n## Common Categories in Drone Laws and Policies (Globally)\n\nHere is a short table on the usual categories in developing drone laws around the world.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Category** | **Description** |\n| Registration | Drone laws may vary depending on the national or local policy on what weight or purpose requires registration. |\n| Airspace Restrictions | Focusing on the airspace restrictions for drone flights in specific locations, such as airports, military areas, or large public gatherings. |\n| Privacy Regulations | It ensures that drone operators avoid unauthorized flights and the gathering of visual data. |\n| Operator Certification | Ensuring safe operations, drone pilots must pass regulatory exams and/or have their license, depending on their purpose and local drone laws. |\n| Insurance and Liability | To cover any future risks, every drone operation should be insured and held liable. |\n\n## What Are The Changes Over Time?\n\nIn between these years, here are some of the several changes that happened in drone laws:\n\n* Many regions have mandated a remote ID system.\n* BVLOS operations have acquired traction with pilot programs.\n* New [traffic management systems](https://www.zenatech.com/traffic-management/) have emerged due to urban air mobility initiatives.\n\nThese developments are just some of the factors that pushed drone law updates in 2025.\n\n## What Are Drone Law Trends in 2025?\n\nAs the year began, the drone market and drone users continued to rise. One of its innovations that pushes the industry to another level is the use of autonomous aerial operations. Consequently, global regulatory bodies are also evolving drone laws and policies.\n\nHere are some predicted legal changes that help policymakers address the transitions of drones, which involve issues such as address, safety, privacy, and international harmonization.\n\n### Expanded No-Fly Zones\n\nIncreased drone activity near sensitive areas \u2014 including government buildings, hospitals, disaster zones, and protected heritage sites \u2014 is prompting tighter restrictions.\n\n* U.S. Example: The FAA expanded restricted zones around federal facilities, chemical plants, and significant sporting events using geofencing and Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) advisories.\n* European Example: EASA advised temporary airspace closures around high-security events like G7 summits and UEFA stadiums.\n\n### Automated Flight Regulations\n\nDrone operations in BVLOS require a legal framework to ensure collision avoidance and command accountability.\n\n* U.S. Example: The FAA launched BVLOS ARC (Aviation Rulemaking Committee) recommendations in early 2025 for scaled autonomous deliveries and remote piloting.\n* Europe Example: EASA updated SORA 2.5 with AI risk modules for autonomous drones in shared airspace.\n\n### Privacy Protections\n\nUnregulated drone surveillance has raised ethical and legal concerns in residential zones and commercial centers.\n\n* U.S. Policy Shift: States like California and New York introduced drone-specific privacy laws prohibiting facial recognition and audio capture without consent.\n* Europe Context: GDPR-compliant drone operations must anonymize or minimize the collection of personal data. Breaching this policy may result in a hefty fine.\n\n### UTM Systems (Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management)\n\nWith increased drone traffic, centralized coordination systems are necessary for airspace safety.\n\n* U.S. Progress: NASA and the FAA\u2019s UTM Pilot Program entered operational testing across major cities, integrating drones with traditional ATC.\n* Europe\u2019s Approach: U-Space Services under EASA are mandatory for certain urban drone flights, especially in controlled and congested environments.\n\n## Global Standardization vs. Local Sovereignty\n\nCross-border drone operations and international logistics demand harmonized rules, while national defense and privacy concerns require tailored laws.\n\nIn the international frameworks, ICAO and [NATO](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2017/07/28/autonomous-military-drones-no-longer-science-fiction/index.html) published interoperability guidelines for commercial and defense-grade drones.\n\nDespite global efforts, there are also regional conflicts. Countries like Germany and France maintain strict sovereign oversight over drones operating near sensitive borders.\n\n## 2025 FAA Guidelines for Drone Pilots\n\n[Legal drone operations](https://www.zenatech.com/different-types-of-drones-and-their-uses/) involve understanding the latest guidelines for drone operation. So, whatever the reason for your drone flight\u2014recreation or business\u2014here is the updated FAA things to remember for all drone operators.\n\n### Drone Registration Rules\n\n* **Weight**: Drones weighing more than 0.55 pounds (250 grams) are required to be registered with the FAA through the [FAADroneZone](https://faadronezone-access.faa.gov/).\n* **Fees**: Each drone should be registered for $5, valid for three years.\n* **Labels**: The drone must visibly display its FAA registration number.\n* **Remote ID Requirements**: All drones flying in unrestricted areas must comply with the FAA.\n\n### Remote ID regulations:\n\n* Drones must broadcast location and identification data.\n* Drones without built-in Remote ID must use an external broadcast module, unless operating in an approved FAA-recognized Identification Area (FRIA).\n\n### Limitations on Altitude\n\n* Drones **cannot fly above 400 feet** to avoid interfering with crewed aircraft.\n* Exceptions may be granted for **authorized commercial activities** with specific FAA permission.\n* Drone pilots must understand the policy under airspace restrictions, where they must apply for a waiver or have **performance-based approvals**, as it is vital to drone capabilities.\n\n### Reliable Airspace Awareness\n\n* Drone operators must avoid restricted areas, which usually include the airways, military headquarters, and national parks.\n* It is also commendable to use the FAA B4UFLY app to identify no-fly zones.\n* Monitor NOTAMs (Notices to Air Missions) for temporary flight restrictions during events, emergencies, or VIP movements.\n\n### Visual Line of Sight Requirement\n\n* At all times, a drone pilot must maintain a direct visual line of sight from their drone.\n* During night operations, it is a requirement for a drone to come with approved anti-collision lights.\n* FPV (First-Person View) flying is allowed only when a visual observer is present to maintain situational awareness.\n\n### Pilot Certification & Training\n\nAll drone pilots flying under Part 107 must complete recurrent training, which now includes emergency procedures, UAS maintenance protocols, and updates on remote ID and airspace access.\n\nNote that these guidelines apply to drone operations in the United States. Drone laws around the world may have different rules and regulations. For that reason, get to know more of some of the known regulatory bodies in the drone industry.\n\n## Legal Drone Operations: Key Regulatory Bodies and Their Roles\n\nUnderstanding who sets and enforces drone legislation is essential for compliance. In 2025, several key organizations are leading the charge in shaping national drone laws and influencing global drone laws. Get to know more about them here.\n\n### Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) \u2013 United States\n\nThe United States has the FAA to govern all civil aviation. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) are one of them. They set the standards and regulations for registration, pilot certification, airspace access, and safety protocols.\n\n**2025 Highlights:**\n\n* Expanded Remote ID enforcement for all drones over 250g.\n* BVLOS ARC recommendations adopted for autonomous operations.\n* Integration of drones into controlled airspace via [LAANC](https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/laanc) and UTM systems.\n* Updated Part 107 rules for commercial drone operators.\n\nDrone operators in the United States are required to follow the FAA rules, as they may face consequences such as fines or license suspension. In addition, the FAA\u2019s decisions often influence international standards due to its global leadership.\n\n### **European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)**\n\nEU member states are overseen by the [EASA](https://european-union.europa.eu/institutions-law-budget/institutions-and-bodies/search-all-eu-institutions-and-bodies/european-union-aviation-safety-agency-easa_en), which oversees aviation operations, including those involving drone technology. The EASA provides unified regulations through the EU drone regulation framework.\n\n**2025 Highlights:**\n\n* Mandatory U-Space services for urban drone flights.\n* Updated SORA 2.5 risk assessment for autonomous drones.\n* Certification pathways for drones up to 600 kg.\n* Harmonized privacy and data protection standards under GDPR.\n\nA legal drone operation in the EU means operators must register their drones, obtain pilot credentials, and follow U-Space protocols. EASA\u2019s unified approach simplifies cross-border drone operations within Europe.\n\n### Transport Canada\n\nTransport Canada regulates drone operations in Canada, balancing innovation with safety and privacy.\n\n**2025 Highlights:**\n\n* Streamlined registration for drones under 25 kg.\n* Updated pilot certification for advanced operations.\n* Introduced new insurance requirements for commercial flights.\n\nCanadian operators must follow Basic or Advanced operation rules, depending on mission complexity. Transport Canada\u2019s policies often mirror FAA and EASA standards.\n\n### International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)\n\nICAO sets global aviation standards and promotes harmonization of drone laws around the world. It collaborates with national authorities to ensure the safe integration of drones into international airspace.\n\n**2025 Highlights:**\n\n* Published global UAS interoperability guidelines.\n* Advocated for standardized Remote ID and [BVLOS frameworks](https://enterprise-insights.dji.com/blog/detailed-overview-of-north-america-bvlos-regulations-for-remote-drone-operations).\n* Supported cross-border drone logistics and humanitarian missions.\n\nICAO\u2019s recommendations influence national policies and help align drone law updates across countries. Operators involved in international missions must follow ICAO protocols.\n\n## **Future Outlook \u2014 What Drone Laws May Look Like in 2030**\n\nAs drone technology becomes embedded in daily life, drone legislation will evolve to address new challenges and opportunities. By 2030, drones may be as common as smartphones \u2014 used for deliveries, inspections, surveillance, and even passenger transport.\n\nSo what should we expect? Here are some of them:\n\n* Autonomous Operations as the Norm\n* Urban Air Mobility (UAM) Integration\n* AI and Machine Learning Regulation\n* Global Harmonization of Drone Laws\n* Smart City Integration\n\nAlthough no one knows what the future holds, it is an apparent fact that future drone laws can be more complex yet comprehensive, given the continuous evolution and upgrading of technology, which enhances their capabilities.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhat are the current drone laws? Answering this question reveals that the drone industry is still thriving in 2025. And with its ever-growing advancements, using this technology comes with a great responsibility. As we\u2019ve explored throughout this guide, understanding and complying with drone laws, both locally and globally, is essential for safe, ethical, and legal operations.\n\nDiscover more about drone laws and operations with [ZenaTech](https://www.zenatech.com/), ensuring you fully comply to enjoy the benefits of drone solutions.\n\n ",

This blog post focuses on the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) regulations that govern all drone operations across EU member states, as well as Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein.\n\n## **EASA drone operator registration requirements**\n\nBefore diving into Remote ID specifics, let\u2019s clarify when drone operators must register with their country\u2019s National Aviation Authority (NAA). Understanding who qualifies as a \u201cdrone operator\u201d is crucial for compliance. The \u201cdrone operator\u201d is the person or entity that owns or rents the drone.\n\nRegistration is exempted only if your drone meets one of these criteria:\n\n* Weighs less than 250 grams (including payload) and has no camera or sensor capable of capturing personal data.\n* Weighs less than 250 grams (including payload) and is classified as a toy under\u00a0[Directive 2009/48/EC](https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/sectors/toys/toy-safety_en)\u00a0(intended for children under 14).\n\nOnce registered, drone operators receive a unique operator registration number valid throughout the entire EU. This number must be physically displayed on all drones using a sticker and entered into each operational drone\u2019s Remote ID system.\n\nPro Tips*Keep your registration current and ensure the operator number is clearly visible on every aircraft. This single registration provides cross-border operational privileges across all EASA member states.*\n\n## **The EASA Drone Classification Scheme ID**\n\nEASA classifies drones based on multiple factors, including weight, capability, and operational risk. The system consists of classes and categories that work together to define compliance requirements. Similar to CE markings on consumer products, drone classes indicate the technical specifications and safety features built into the aircraft:\n\n* C0: Under 250g\n* C1: Under 900g with specific safety features\n* C2: Under 4kg with enhanced capabilities\n* C3: Under 25kg\n* C4: Under 25kg without automatic control (traditional model aircraft)\n* C5 and C6: Specific category operations with certification requirements\n\nThe three operational categories, Open, Specific, and Certified, are based on risk assessment:\n\n* Open category: Low-risk operations, typically for hobbyists and basic commercial use. No prior authorization is required, but strict limits apply, including maintaining Visual Line of Sight (VLOS), altitude restrictions, and limitations on proximity to people. The Open category has three subcategories: A1 (over people with restrictions), A2 (near people with a safe distance), and A3 (far from people).\n* Specific category: Moderate-risk operations that fall outside the Open category (most commercial BVLOS flights) require a risk assessment ([SORA](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/drones-air-mobility/operating-drone/specific-category-civil-drones/specific-operations-risk-assessment-sora)\u00a0or\u00a0[PDRA](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/drones-air-mobility/operating-drone/specific-category-civil-drones/predefined-risk-assessment-pdra)) or declaration for Standard scenarios and operational authorization from the national aviation authority (NAA). Remote ID functionality is mandatory.\n* Certified Category: High-risk operations, such as urban air mobility, passenger transport, dangerous goods transport, and complex urban operations. This category requires full certification, similar to manned aviation, including certified drones, licensed pilots, operator approval, and comprehensive safety systems.\n\nPro Tips*Most commercial drone operations fall into either the Open A3 subcategory (far from people) or the Specific category. Understanding which applies to your mission is essential for compliance planning.*\n\n## **What Is the EASA\u2019s Remote ID Regulation (2025)?**\n\nSince January 1, 2024, Remote ID has been mandatory across EASA jurisdictions for most drone operations. Here\u2019s what you need to know about compliance.\n\n**What Is Remote ID?**\n\nThink of Remote ID as a digital license plate for your drone. It broadcasts identification information that authorities and the public can receive via smartphone applications, enhancing airspace safety and accountability.\n\n**Which Drones Require Remote ID?**\n\nRemote ID is required for all drones operating in the Specific category and all drones with class marks (C1, C2, C3, C5, C6) operating in the Open category.\n\nThe following drones are exempt from Remote ID requirements:\n\n* Class C0 drones: Maximum take-off weight under 250g, including payload.\n* Tethered C3 drones: Must weigh less than 25kg, be electrically powered, attached to a tether under 50 meters, equipped with geo-awareness, and have low battery alerts.\n* Class C4 drones: Under 25kg with no automatic control modes except flight stabilization (intended for traditional model aircraft enthusiasts).\n\nEASA has adopted Direct Remote ID, also known as\u00a0[Broadcast Remote ID](https://www.elsight.com/remote-id/), as the current implementation method. This one-way broadcast system doesn\u2019t require internet connectivity and can be received by anyone with appropriate equipment in the vicinity.\n\nDrones can comply through built-in functionality or add-on modules. Both options must broadcast continuously during flight using open, documented protocols (non-ADS-B or Automatic Dependent Surveillance). The required broadcast data transmission must include:\n\n* UAS operator registration number (with verification)\n* Unique serial number of the drone\n* Real-time geographical position and height above the surface or take-off point\n* Heading and ground speed\n* Geographical position of the operator or take-off point\n* Emergency status indicator\n* Timestamp\n\nThe drone system must prevent modification of all data except the operator registration number, ensuring data integrity.\n\nPro Tips*When selecting a Remote ID add-on module, verify that it meets EASA requirements. Not all modules meet the strict European requirements.*\n\n## **How are BVLOS operations classified under the EASA Regulation?**\n\n[BVLOS](https://www.elsight.com/bvlos/)\u00a0(beyond visual line of sight) drone operations require special consideration under EASA rules. All drones in the Open category must be operated within Visual Line of Sight (VLOS), meaning BVLOS flights automatically fall under either the Specific or Certified categories.\n\nThe Specific category BVLOS operations require compliance with either:\n\n* Standard Scenarios (STS): Pre-defined scenarios with declared compliance, which include STS-01 (VLOS operations over controlled ground area) and STS-02 (BVLOS with airspace observers over controlled ground area). As of August 30, 2024, operators can no longer submit national standard scenario (STS-ES) declarations of conformity in many member states.\n* Individual Risk Assessment: A case-by-case authorization using\u00a0[SORA](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/drones-air-mobility/operating-drone/specific-category-civil-drones/specific-operations-risk-assessment-sora)\u00a0(Specific Operations Risk Assessment) and\u00a0[PDRA](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/drones-air-mobility/operating-drone/specific-category-civil-drones/predefined-risk-assessment-pdra)\u00a0(Pre-Defined Risk Assessment).\n\nThe Certified category applies to the highest-risk BVLOS operations, including urban air mobility (UAM), package delivery in populated areas, passenger transport, dangerous goods transport, and operations over assemblies of people. These operations require the same level of oversight as manned aviation, including certified aircraft, licensed pilots, and comprehensive safety management systems.\n\nPro Tips*Most commercial BVLOS applications, such as inspections, surveys, and agricultural monitoring, operate under the Specific category. Start your authorization process early\u2014obtaining approvals can take several months.*\n\n## **Network Remote ID: The Future of European Drone Connectivity**\n\nWhile Direct Remote ID is currently mandated, EASA is actively developing Network Remote ID requirements as part of the broader U-space initiative. U-space is a set of services and digital infrastructure defined by EASA and the EU to coordinate drones in low-altitude airspace, ensuring safe access while enabling commercial, industrial, and public-safety drone operations to scale.\n\nNetwork Remote ID transmits drone identification information to centralized service providers via internet connectivity, enabling tracking over longer distances, integration with air traffic management systems, coordination of complex missions in shared airspace, and enhanced situational awareness for authorities.\n\nNetwork Remote ID is mandatory for participation in U-space, Europe\u2019s UTM (Unmanned Traffic Management) system for safely and efficiently\u00a0managing drone traffic. U-space only applies in designated U-space airspace, which individual EU states activate when needed. As U-space zones expand across Europe, operators will need solutions that support both Direct and Network Remote ID.\n\nPro Tips*While Network Remote ID isn\u2019t yet universally mandated, selecting connectivity solutions that support both broadcast and network capabilities ensures you\u2019re prepared for evolving regulations.*\n\n## **Elsight\u2019s Halo: Robust BVLOS Connectivity and Remote ID for EASA-Compliant Operations**\n\nCompliance with EASA regulations requires more than just Remote ID. It demands reliable, redundant connectivity that keeps your operations safe and your data flowing. Elsight\u2019s\u00a0[Halo BVLOS communication module](https://www.elsight.com/products/allsight-drone-cloud-management-platform/heatsight-visualizing-connectivity/)\u00a0includes multilink operation that aggregates up to four cellular channels, SATcom, and other RF links into a single virtual tunnel, with advanced traffic monitoring, load balancing, and seamless handoff capabilities. The Halo is EASA compliant, including built-in Remote ID functionality, providing continuous connectivity and maximum safety for BVLOS operations. The compact module fits into a small SWaP (size, weight, and power) footprint, making it ideal for drones in a variety of EASA classes and categories.\n\nWhether you\u2019re conducting infrastructure inspections, precision agriculture operations, emergency response missions, or commercial deliveries, Halo provides the robust connectivity foundation your EASA-compliant operations demand.\n\n## **Key takeaways**\n\n* Remote ID is mandatory in all EASA states for most drone operations since January 2024.\n* Operators must register unless flying a drone weighing less than 250g with no data-capturing sensors or toy classification.\n* Drone classes (C0\u2013C6) define technical standards and safety features required for compliance.\n* Operational categories\u2014Open, Specific, and Certified\u2014determine the risk level and authorization needed.\n* Open category flights require VLOS and impose strict altitude and proximity-to-people limits.\n* BVLOS operations fall under the Specific or Certified categories and require compliance with SORA, PDRA, or STS.\n* Certified operations cover the highest-risk BVLOS missions, including UAM and deliveries in populated areas.\n* Direct Remote ID broadcasts real-time identification data and is required for all C1\u2013C6 drones. Exemptions apply only to C0 drones, C4 model aircraft, and specific tethered C3 systems.\n* U-space provides digital air traffic services for drones in designated airspace and requires Network Remote ID.\n* Elsight\u2019s Halo BVLOS communication module provides robust connectivity with built-in Remote ID functionality, supporting multilink, secure, BVLOS-ready connectivity.\n\n**FAQs**\n\n1. **Which drones need Remote ID under EASA regulations?**\n\nMost drones operating in the Open (C1\u2013C3) and Specific (C5\u2013C6) categories require Direct Remote ID. Exemptions apply only to C0 drones weighing less than 250g, C4 model aircraft, and some tethered C3 drones that meet strict technical conditions.\n\n1. **What approvals are required for BVLOS operations in the Specific category?**\n\nBVLOS operations under the Specific category require a Standard Scenario declaration (STS-02) or an operational authorization based on a SORA or PDRA. Approval timelines vary and may take several months.\n\n1. **What is the difference between Direct Remote ID and Network Remote ID?**\n\nDirect Remote ID broadcasts drone identification locally during flight. Network Remote ID sends identification data to service providers via network connectivity. Direct Remote ID is mandatory today, while Network Remote ID will be required for operations inside U-space airspace\n\nTo find out more about how Halo can help you develop your EASA-compliant BVLOS drone platform, please get in touch!\n\n**Related resources**\n\n* [Remote ID for Drones & UAV\u2019s: Ensuring Safety in the Sky](https://www.elsight.com/blog/internal-review-on-remote-id/)\n* [Compliance with FAA Remote ID Regulations](https://www.elsight.com/remote-id/faa-compliance/)\n* [Unlocking the Potential of Remote ID for the Drone Industry](https://www.elsight.com/blog/unlocking-the-potential-of-remote-id-for-the-drone-industry/)\n* [The FAA\u2019s overview of Remote ID regulations for drone pilots](https://www.elsight.com/remote-id/faa-compliance/)\n\nContact Us\n\nAwesome **resources**\n\n[Elsight\u2019s Halo Awarded through U.S. Defense Innovation Unit\u2019s (DIU) Project GI for Reliable Connectivity in Contested Domains\n\nReading time: 2 minutesElsight Selected by the DIU of the Department of War (DOW) for Phase 3 of Project G.I.

It contains all the important information that drone pilots need to know if they want to fly legally with their drone. In addition to this, the individual countries can still add their own regulations, but they are all based on the EU laws.\n\nOn the following page we provide you with an overview of the current EU drone laws 2024 with all the important information that is relevant for drone pilots. Individual sub-areas are also addressed in more detail in separate articles. In this way, we want to keep the article as comprehensive and yet as lean as possible.\n\nPlease note: The information on this page has been compiled to the best of our knowledge and is partly freely translated. Many texts are currently still available as drafts and/or in English. Should there be any changes to the regulations before or after the official launch, we will of course update this page.\n\n## New EU Drone Regulation 2024 \u2013 what has changed?\n\nWith the introduction of the EU Drone Regulation at the end of 2020, the laws surrounding unmanned air traffic were standardized within the EU \u2013 as far as possible. This inevitably led to deviations in the drone regulation from 2017 that was valid in Germany until then.\n\n* Increase of the maximum flight altitude from 100m to 120m\n* Adjustment of weight limits\n* Registration of drone pilots\n* Introduction of two different drone pilot certificates (EU certificate of competence and EU remote pilot certificate\n* eID for drones\n\nThe EU Drone Regulation is additionally structured as follows:\n\n* Classification of drones into classes (C0 \u2013 C5)\n* Classification into application scenarios (Open, Specific, Certified)\n\nThe following paragraphs describe the above points in detail.\n\n## Application scenarios of the EU Drone Regulation 2024\n\nEach drone flight is classified into one of three categories based on its characteristics: Open, Specific and Certified. The Open category is further subdivided into three subcategories A1, A2 and A3. If a drone flight cannot be assigned to any subcategory of the Open category, it automatically slips into the Specific category. If the application is not covered there either, the highest classification is reached, the Certified class.\n\nFor most hobby pilots, the Open category will apply most often, while commercial drone pilots will have to distinguish between Open and Specific. The Certified category will play little role for most drone pilots and will likely apply mostly only to industrial companies such as drone delivery services and similar businesses.\n\n## Use Case Scenario: Open\n\n* No permits necessary\n* Compulsory insurance for all drone pilots\n* Low risk drone flights\n* Flight only allowed within visual range\n* No transport of dangerous goods\n* No dropping of objects\n* Depending on subcategory/drone class Online training\u2026\n* \u2026drone pilot license\u2026\n* \u2026or registration of the drone pilot necessary\n* Minimum age may be chosen by each member state. In Germany it is 16 years, except for toy drones according to directive 2009/48/EC (drones under 250g without camera or sensors for recording) for which there is no age classification\n* A drone license plate with EU registration number (eID) of the drone pilot is required. Except for toy drones (drones under 250g and without recording function).\n* In addition, there are regulations of the respective EU member state. For example, they themselves may define so-called \u201cNo Fly Zones\u201d (no-fly zones) or certain additional restrictions, which must also be adhered to. This usually concerns airfields, military installations, prisons, government buildings and in Germany probably also residential areas (flight only with the consent of the property owner should remain, for example), see section \u201cNo Fly Zones\u201d in the article on the \u201cold\u201d drone regulation).\n* In Germany, these zones are being discussed in a current draft law and should find their way into the German Air Traffic Regulations (LuftVO) in the course of 2021. Until then, the points of the old drone ordinance will still apply, unless they deviate from the points of the EU drone ordinance mentioned in this article. In that case, the laws of the new regulation already apply.\n* Further restrictions additionally result from the drone class (C0-C4). More on this below.\n\n### Subcategory A1\n\n* Flight over people possible (depending on the C classification of the drone).\n* Overflight of uninvolved third parties must be avoided\n* No overflight over crowds of people\n\n### Subcategory A2\n\n* Flight at a safe distance from uninvolved persons (at least 30m).\n* For drones that have a \u201cSlow\u201d mode, the distance can be reduced to 5m\n\n### Subcategory A3\n\n* Flight only at a great distance from people\n* no uninvolved third parties in the entire flight area\n* minimum distance to residential, industrial and commercial areas of at least 150m\n\n### Overview graphic\n\nThe following graphic provides a coherent overview of the requirements for the Open application scenario, its subcategories A1, A2 and A3, ando the drone risk classes C0-C4 presented further below.\n\n## Use Case Scenario: Specific\n\nIf the planned drone flight does not meet one or more of the criteria listed in the Open category, it automatically slips into the Specific category. In this case, a separate SORA-GER risk assessment is required for the operation. This must be submitted to the authority in order to obtain an exemption for the planned flight.\n\nAlternatively, so-called standard scenarios can be used, which make a corresponding SORA-GER assessment superfluous and should simplify the approval process. Two standard scenarios are known to us so far:\n\n* STS-01 \u2013 VLOS (Visual Line of Sight) over a controlled area on the ground in a populated area.\n* STS-02 \u2013 BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line of Sight) over a controlled area on the ground in a sparsely populated area with airspace observer\n\nAuthorities are free to create further standard scenarios themselves. As soon as we receive more information, we will update this section.\n\nWith a LUC certificate (light UAS operator certificate), the application for authorization can be reduced to a one-time application. However, the cost and effort of a LUC certificate is not yet foreseeable. It is equivalent to a comprehensive certification of the drone pilot or the operation itself and will therefore be neither cheap nor quick to obtain.\n\n## Use Case Scenario: Certified (Certified)\n\n* Extensive approval procedures\n* Use cases: Overflight of crowds, transport of people or loads, transport of dangerous goods.\n* Not relevant for hobby pilots as well as for commercial drone pilots from the field of aerial photography\n\n## Drone classes C0-C4 of the EU Drone Regulation 2024\n\nIn the future, drones will be divided into five different risk classes marked C0 to C4. The class of a drone will be decisive for the category in which it can be flown and the requirements that are placed on the drone pilot.\n\nThe classification into a class is carried out by the manufacturer of the drone itself on the basis of established guidelines. The label will then be available to view before a drone is purchased.\n\nCurrently, there are only a handful of drones with appropriate C designations. Therefore, most current drones that will have to do without a C-label will fall into a special category and be listed as so-called inventory drones (more on this below, \u201cTransition phase for existing drones\u201d).\n\nIn this way, drones already on the market should be able to be used without any problems even with the new EU drone regulation. The following paragraphs provide an overview of the respective classes C0-C4. More details can be found in our separate article on the EU drone classes.\n\n### Drone class C0\n\nThe following drones included:\n\n* Weight of the drone is less than 250 grams (also for homebuilt drones).\n* Self-built drone over 250 grams falls under class C3 or C4\n\nSpecifications for the manufacturer/drone\n\n* The drone must not fly faster than 19 m/s (68 km/h)\n* Maximum flight altitude must be adjustable\n\nRegulations for this class\n\n* Drone pilot must read instruction manual\n* Drone pilot must register if there is a camera on the drone (in this case, it is also necessary to attach the license plate with the registration number of the drone pilot)\n* no EU drone license/EU proof of competence is necessary\n* It is allowed to fly in all subcategories of the Open application scenario, i.e. also over people (no crowds)\n\n### Drone class C1\n\nThe following drones included\n\n* Weight of the drone is less than 900 grams or the kinetic energy is less than 80 joules\n\nSpecifications for the manufacturer/drone\n\n* The drone must not fly faster than 19 m/s (68 km/h)\n* Maximum flight altitude must be adjustable\n* Return-to-home function must be available\n* Electronic identification (eID) is required\n* GEO awareness system (automatic flight restriction monitoring) is required\n\nRegulations for this class\n\n* Drone pilot must read instruction manual\n* Drone pilot must have EU certificate of competence (online training and online test), also known as \u201csmall EU drone license\u201d\n* Drone pilot must register and affix a drone license plate/badge with registration number to the drone\n* Flights from subcategory A1 in the Open application scenario possible (but no flight over people)\n\n### Drone class C2\n\nThe following drones included\n\n* Weight of the drone is less than 4 kilograms\n\nSpecifications for the manufacturer/drone\n\n* Maximum flight altitude must be adjustable\n* Return-to-home function must be available\n* Low-speed mode must be available\n* Electronic identification (eID) is required\n* GEO awareness system (automatic flight restriction monitoring) is required\n\nRegulations for this class\n\n* Drone pilot must read instruction manual\n* Drone pilot must have EU certificate of competence (online training and online test), also known as \u201csmall EU drone license\u201d\n* Drone pilot must register and affix a drone license plate/badge with registration number to the drone\n* For flights in subcategory A2 of the Open application scenario, the drone pilot must pass a theoretical test at a recognized testing center (EU remote pilot certificate or also known as \u201clarge drone driver\u2019s license\u201d)\n* A minimum distance of 30 meters from people must be maintained (subcategory A2)\n* However, when low-speed mode is activated (max. 3 m/s), the 1:1 rule applies in terms of altitude and distance to people. This means that at a flight altitude of 10m, you may fly up to 10m away from people. However, the distance must never be less than 5m.\n* Flights also possible in subcategory A3 of the application scenario Open\n\n### Drone class C3 and C4\n\nThe following drones included\n\n* Weight of the drone is less than 25 kilograms or drone is a homemade with more than 250 grams\n\nSpecifications for the manufacturer/drone\n\n* Maximum flight altitude must be adjustable\n* Return-to-home function must be available\n* Electronic identification (eID) is required\n* GEO awareness system (automatic flight restriction monitoring) is required\n* No autonomous flight allowed (class C4)\n\nRegulations for this class\n\n* Drone pilot must read instruction manual\n* Drone pilot must have EU certificate of competence (online training and online test), also known as \u201csmall EU drone license\u201d\n* Drone pilot must register and affix a drone license plate/badge with registration number to the drone\n* Flight only possible in subcategory A3 of the Open application scenario. So it is only allowed to fly outside of cities and only where no uninvolved persons can be endangered.\n\nSource: easa.europa.eu \u2013 [(EU) 2019/945](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019R0945)\n\n### Transition phase for existing drones\n\nSince there are only a few drones with the new C classification so far (as of July 2023), a transitional arrangement exists for most drones on the market (drones manufactured before Jan. 1, 2024, that do not have a C label).\n\nThe drones are allocated depending on their weight and corresponding restrictions are imposed. These can be found in summary in the list below. These drones can be flown without a C-label until Dec. 31, 2023 (validity of the transitional arrangement) depending on their weight in all subcategories of Open (A1 \u2013 A3, see list below).\n\nIt is officially called limited Open category by EASA.\n\n**Existing drones without C-classification (until 31.12.2023)**\n\n* Here, too, insurance is mandatory for all drones\n* Drone pilot must read operating instructions\n\n**Drones under 500g**\n\n* Flight possible in all subcategories (A1, A2, A3) of the Open application scenario\n* No EU drone license required (neither EU certificate of competence nor EU remote pilot certificate).\n* From 01.01.2024: EU certificate of competence required for operation of drones over 250g and under 500g in subcategory A1.\n\n**Drones from 500g and under 2kg**\n\n* Flight in subcategory A2 and A3 of the application scenario Open possible.\n* EU proficiency certificate (small EU drone license) for A3 and \u2026\n* EU remote pilot certificate (large EU drone license) required for operation in subcategory A2. Here, however, with increased distance to people (50m instead of 30m as for drones with C classification).\n* Note: Thanks to transitional regulation until 31.12.2023 also 30m for existing drones.\n\n**Drones from 2kg and under 25kg**\n\n* Flight in subcategory A3 of the application scenario Open possible\n* EU certificate of competence (small EU drone license) required for flights in subcategory A3\n\nFrom 01.01.2024, drones without C classification can be flown in A1 if the weight is below 250g (no EU drone license required) and in A3 (EU proof of competence required) if the weight is below 25kg.\n\nFlights in the A2 subcategory would therefore no longer be possible with existing drones weighing more than 250g. ([EASA FAQ](https://www.easa.europa.eu/faq/116508))\n\n## Insurance obligation\n\nRegardless of any new regulations and whether flying is private or commercial, drone insurance is always mandatory in Germany. This is already the case with the existing drone regulation.\n\nWe have summarized all information on drone liability insurance in the linked article. Our recommendation here is the favorable insurance coverage from [helden.de (ab 39\u20ac/Jahr)](https://helden.de/drohnenhaftpflicht/?src=dhpt&presetVoucher=DHPT4&utm_source=ner&utm_medium=li&utm_campaign=de.po.ro.sa)\\*.\n\n## Drone pilot registration\n\nThe online registration application for drone owners is available online. We have compiled important information on this in a corresponding news item.\n\nWe have summarized all information on registration and marking according to the current EU Drone Regulation in the following article: [**Registrierung und Kennzeichnung \u2013 eID \u2013 EU-Drohnenverordnung**](https://www.skyzr.com/registrierung-und-kennzeichnung-eid-eu-drohnenverordnung/)\n\n## EU Drone Operator Licenses of the EU Drone Regulation 2024\n\nAs mentioned several times above, the new EU Drone Regulation also introduces two new \u201cdrone operator licenses\u201d.\n\n* EU certificate of competence (\u201csmall EU drone pilot\u2019s license\u201d)\n* EU Remote Pilot Certificate (\u201clarge EU drone pilot\u2019s license\u201d)\n\nBoth \u201cdriving licenses\u201d will become mandatory as of 01.01.2021 in the respective required subcategory and C-classification (see notes above).\n\n### EU proof of competence\n\n* Online training\n* Online test\n* may be repeated as often as desired\n* probably free of charge and can be done online directly at the LBA\n* Validity: 5 years\n\n### EU Remote Pilot Certificate\n\n* EU proof of competence is a prerequisite\n* Practical self-training required (own written confirmation sufficient)\n* Theory test at a certified testing center required, usually in combination with a training course\n* Validity: 5 years\n* Fee-based, as carried out by external and certified providers\n\nIt is very likely that the official examining bodies that have been offering the proficiency test up to now will gradually switch over to the EU Remote Pilot Certificate as well.\n\nWe have summarized everything else that is important about EU drone licenses for you in our article EU Drone License \u2013 All Information.\n\n### What happens to an old issued certificate of knowledge?\n\nSo far, it is planned to keep the current drone knowledge certificates valid until the end of 2021. After that, they can be converted into the small EU drone license (i.e. EU certificate of competence).\n\nMore information will follow in a separate article.\n\n## Sources on the EU Drone Regulation\n\nThe official source for the EU Drone Regulation is EASA (European Union Aviation Safety Agency). Here you can find all official documents, draft laws and further information. The entire site is in English. Some documents are available in different languages. Particularly relevant here are the regulations [(EU) 2019/945](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32019R0945&from=EN) as well as [(EU) 2019/947](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32019R0947).\n\nThe Luftfahrt Bundesamt (LBA) [offers a short FAQ on the new EU drone regulation (german)](https://www.lba.de/DE/Drohnen/Allgemeine_Informationen/Allgemeine_Informationen_node.html), which we also used as a source for our article.\n\n## EU Drone Regulation 2024 FAQ\n\n**Since when is the current EU Drone Regulation 2024 in force?**\n\nThe current EU Drone Regulation 2024 has already been in force since 01.01.2021. Our detailed article provides all information on the current EU regulations.\n\n**Do I need drone insurance according to the EU Drone Regulation 2024?**\n\nYes, with the current EU Drone Regulation 2024, drone liability insurance is always mandatory. You are not allowed to fly without it.\n\n**Do I have to register as a drone pilot?**\n\nUnder the current EU Drone Regulation 2024, it may be mandatory to officially register as a drone pilot with the LBA. This depends on the risk class (C0-C4) of the drone used. We have summarized all the information in this article on the EU Drone Regulation.\n\n**What changes will the new EU Drone Regulation 2024 bring?**\n\nWith the current EU Drone Regulation, there have been numerous changes in the operation of drones. You can read all about the application scenarios and the new drone risk classes in our article on the EU Drone Regulation 2024.\n\n**Can I continue to use my existing certificate of knowledge?**\n\nThe German certificate of proficiency was valid until the end of 2021. It could be rewritten into the new EU certificate of competence (small EU drone license). More info can be found in the article.\n\n**What is the EU drone license?**\n\nWith the EU Drone Regulation 2024, there are two drone licenses: the small (EU Certificate of Competence) and the large (EU Remote Pilot Certificate). Depending on the drone risk class, one of the two may be necessary.

Our innovative marketplace platform is set to handle any clients today, tomorrow, and beyond.\n\nAndreas Nordansj\u00f6\n\nChief Marketing Officer\n\n# What you need to know about the 2024 EU Drone Regulations | Stay compliant with Globhe\n\nAre you prepared for the upcoming 2024 EU drone regulations? With significant changes just around the corner, understanding and adhering to these new standards is crucial for everyone in the drone industry. With Globhe however, we help our clients with the complaince, libaility and security, so they can focus on what they do best. We are the data collection partner you need when the industry is undergoing changes and opening up for a broader and more comprehensive use of drones in the future.\n\nWith this article we hope to shed some light on what is changing, and how Globhe have prepared to make sure we are compliant today, tomorrow and in a more distant future.\n\n\u200d\n\n## **New EU Drone Regulations**\n\nWhat is the new regulations put in place all about? The **European Union Aviation Safety Agency** (EASA) is putting in place comprehensive regulations, effective January 1, 2024 to ensure Europe is in the forefront of drone use and pave the way for future use-cases and extensive drone use across all fields of application. Let's explore what these particular changes are, and what they mean for drone operators.\u00a0Drones are classified into open, specific, and certified categories, each with unique operational limitations and compliance requirements. For instance, the open category caters to lower-risk activities, while the certified category addresses high-risk operations.\n\n\u200d\n\n#### **C Classifications**\u200d\n\nFrom January 1st, 2024, new drones placed on the market must have a C classification marking to be used in the open category. Existing drones can still be used under certain conditions. [***Read the information on\u00a0EASA\u00a0website here.***](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones) A quick summary is:\n\n1. Drones under 250 g can be flown in subcategory A1.\n2. Drones under 25 kg can be flown in subcategory A3.\n3. Drones weighing 250 g or more require the completion of the A1/A3 online theoretical examination.\n4. Flying in subcategory A2 is only possible with a C2-class drone\u200b\u200b.\n\n\u200d\n\n#### There are seven C classifications for drones:\n\n1. C0 and C1 are for the open subcategory A1.\n2. C2 is for the open subcategory A2.\n3. C2, C3, and C4 are for the open subcategory A3.\n4. C5 and C6 are for operations that require an operating permit and are subject to a fee\u200b\u200b.\n\n\u200d\n\n#### **Mandatory Registration and Identification**\u200d\n\nA critical aspect of these regulations is that Remote Identification for Drones will become mandatory starting Januari 1st, 2024, enhancing airspace safety and accountability across the EU.[***Read the information on\u00a0EASA\u00a0website here.***](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/general-publications/remote-identification-will-become-mandatory-drones-across)\n\n\u200d\n\n#### **Operational Authorization and Stringent Standards**\u200d\n\nOperations under the specific category require authorization from National Aviation Authorities, including operations beyond visual line of sight and those involving heavier drones.\n\nRead and understand all regulations at the official [***EASA Civil Drones Page***](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones)***.***\n\n\u200d\n\n### **Globhe: Paving the Way for Compliance and Efficiency**\n\n**\u200d**Navigating these regulations might seem challenging, but Globhe simplifies the process.

It defines the conditions the operator must observe when conduct all flights in the operation:\n\n#### Where to apply?\n\nThe applicant needs to apply to the [National Aviation Authority (NAA)](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones/naa) in the state where he/she is registered as an operator.\n\n#### What is to be provided in the application for the operational authorisation?\n\nA duly filled [application form](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/downloads/137214/en), a copy of the Operations Manual (OM) (please check the [EASA Operations Manual example for UAS operations at SAIL II](/en/document-library/general-publications/easa-operations-manual-example-uas-operations-sail-ii)) and of the compliance evidence document whose content varies depending on the risk of operation. For example, for low risk operations, the documents may be very small and simple.\u00a0The OM ([example for SAIL II UAS operations](/en/document-library/general-publications/easa-operations-manual-example-uas-operations-sail-ii)) should contain all information that the staff of the operator should know in order to ensure the safety of the operation. It contains a detailed description of the intended operations, as well as an insight of the organisation\u2019s culture and the operating procedures.\n\n#### Operational authorisation with a [PDRA](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-rpas/specific-category-civil-drones/predefined-risk-assessment-pdra)\n\nIf the operation you intend to conduct is covered by one of the published [PDRAs](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-rpas/specific-category-civil-drones/predefined-risk-assessment-pdra) you need to submit to the NAA a copy of the:\n\n![Apply for authorisation](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Apply%20for%20authorisation.png)\n\n![Apply for authorisation](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Apply%20for%20authorisation.png)\n\nThe PDRA table helps you to develop the operator manual that should contain all information that a staff of the operator should know in order to ensure the safety of the operation. It contains a detailed description of the intended operations, as well as an insight of the organization\u2019s culture and the operating procedures.\n\n#### Operational authorisation without a PDRA\n\nIf the operation intended to be conducted is not covered by any PDRA you need to firstly carry out a specific risk assessment. [Regulation (EU) 2019/947](/en/document-library/regulations/commission-implementing-regulation-eu-2019947) proposes the [SORA (specific operational risk assessment)](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-rpas/specific-category-civil-drones/specific-operations-risk-assessment-sora) methodology to be used for this purpose. You can find the SORA As the AMC 1 to Article 11 of Regulation (EU) 2019/947.\n\nThis methodology helps to identify the risk level of the operation and also to identify the mitigations and operational safety objectives needed to make the operation safe. When the drone operator believes to have properly classified the operation he/she should contact the [National Aviation Authority (NAA)](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones/naa) to apply for an operational authorization and have the NAA to review the risk assessment.\n\n![Pic4](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Picture4_0.png)\n\n![Pic4](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Picture4_0.png)\n\nThen the drone operator should demonstrate compliance with all mitigations and safety objectives to be ready for completing the application.\n\n![pic5](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Picture5_0.png)\n\n![pic5](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Picture5_0.png)\n\n*The main requirements of this risk assessment can be found in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) 2019/947.*  \n  \nAt this moment the UAS operator needs to submit to the NAA a copy of:\n\n![Apply for authorisation](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Apply%20for%20authorisation_0.png)\n\n![Apply for authorisation](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Apply%20for%20authorisation_0.png)\n\n#### Authorising an operational application\n\n(Article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2019/947)  \nThe NAA will issue an operational authorisation, when it considers that the risks are adequately mitigated. Then it will provide the drone operator with the [operational authorisation](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/downloads/137214/en) as soon as possible, and the operation can then start. See below If you want to operate in a state different from the state of registration.\n\n#### Validity of an authorisation\n\nThe operational authorisation will be valid in all EASA member state for all flights conducted within the limitations and duration defined in the authorisation. However, the NAA may impose a limitation in time and/or number of flights.\u00a0  \nOperation in a state different from the state of registration (Article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2019/947) please see the [dedicated page](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-rpas/specific-category-civil-drones/operations-specific-category-state-different-one-registration).\n\n#### Drone authorisation process with an NAA\n\nAs a drone operator in the EASA Member States it is important to get an authorisation from the [National Aviation Authority (NAA)](/domains/civil-drones/naa) of the country in which your organisation is based.\n\nOperational authorisations are needed to start a drone operation in the specific category. An authorisation is not needed if the operation is covered by a Standard Scenario or you already have a Light UAS operator certificate - LUC with the appropriate privileges.\n\nThe authorization process involves submitting an application to the NAA and includes an assessment of the risk of the intended operations, the provision of the organisation\u2019s Operations Manual (OM) and the required evidence to show compliance with the applicable requirements. It is also necessary to demonstrate competence as a drone operator and evidence of training, certifications and experience will be required to demonstrate your ability to conduct operations safely and responsibly.\n\nThe National Aviation Authorities will evaluate the applications and grant authorizations. They review your application, and ensure your operations comply with the regulatory requirements. Effective communication and collaboration with the NAA is vital throughout the authorization process. Respond promptly to any requests for additional information, provide accurate details to ensure a smooth process.\u00a0 The timeline for authorization may vary depending on the complexity of your operations and the workload of the Authority. It is advisable to submit your application well in advance to allow sufficient time for processing.\n\nObtaining an authorization demonstrates your compliance with the applicable requirements and it allows you to conduct specific category operations. These requirements are proportionate to risk level of your operation.\n\nThe authorisation is issued once the operator has shown compliance with the applicable requirements of the European Drone Rules in Regulation (EU) 2019/947, which is applicable since 31 December 2020. More information can be found on the [operating a drone](/operating-drone) page. This harmonizes the rules for drone operations across the European Union, including Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein \u2013 [the EASA Member States](/domains/drones-air-mobility/topics/easa-member-states). Once you receive your authorisation, this means you can use it to operate your drone in all these countries.\n\nIn summary, contact the NAA in the EASA country where you are based. They will then guide your through the full process and inform you on what authorisations and permits you need for your type of activity.\n\nFor additional information please [contact the team](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/contact-us-aviation?select=Aviation&aviation=Drones).\n\n##### [**EASA Website create account**](/user/register)**Stay informed on** Operational authorisation**:**\n\n![EASA Website create account](/sites/default/files/inline-images/easa-website-follow-create-account.png)\n\n### Downloads\n\n#### [Form for Application for an operational authorisation for the \u2018specific\u2019 category](/en/downloads/138404/en \"form_for_application_for_an_operational_authorisation.pdf\")\n\n#### [Form for Operational authorisation for the \u2018specific\u2019 category](/en/downloads/138405/en \"form_for_operational_authorisation.pdf\")\n\n#### [EASA Operations Manual example for UAS operations at SAIL II](/en/downloads/138411/en \"easa_operations_manual_example_for_uas_operations_in_sail_ii_1.docx\")\n\n### Related Content\n\n### [Easy Access Rules for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (Regulations (EU) 2019/947 and 2019/945)](/en/document-library/easy-access-rules/easy-access-rules-unmanned-aircraft-systems-regulations-eu)\n\n### [Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/947](/en/document-library/regulations/commission-implementing-regulation-eu-2019947)\n\n## ONLINE SERVICES\n\n## READ MORE\n\n## WEBSITE\n\n## CONNECT WITH US\n\n## CAN WE HELP YOU?\n\n![EU](/themes/custom/easa_foundation/images/eu_flag_small.png)",

To assess these risk levels, [EASA](https://www.easa.europa.eu) has created several flight categories **(Open, Specific)** which require the use of standardized drones that have received a class indication **(C0-C6)**.\n\n#### [Drone Open & Specific Summary for 2024](#1)\n\n[E](#2)\n\n#### [What is the open category?](#2)\n\n[E](#3)\n\n#### [What is the Specific category?](#3)\n\n[E](#4)\n\n#### [What are standard scenarios (STS)?](#4)\n\n[E](#5)\n\n#### [How to convert your drone into a C5 class ?](#5)\n\n[E](#6)\n\n#### [How do I fly outside STS scenarios in a specific category?](#6)\n\n[E](#7)\n\n#### [What is a PDRA (Pre-Defined Risk Assessment)?](#7)\n\n[E](#8)\n\n#### [What is a SORA (Specific Operations Risk Assessment)?](#8)\n\n[E](#9)\n\n#### [What is IGRC (Intrisinc Ground Risk Class) ?](#9)\n\n[E](#10)\n\n#### [What is Final GRC (Final Ground Risk Class) ?](#10)\n\n[E](#11)\n\n#### [What are MOC (Mean Of Compliance) ?](#11)\n\n[E](#12)\n\n#### [How to reduce Final GRC with MOC2512 (M2)?](#12)\n\n[E](#13)\n\n#### [How to complete part 8 with MOC2511 ?](#13)\n\n[E](#14)\n\n#### [What is a LUC (Light UAS Operator Certificate)?](#14)\n\n## Drone Open & Specific Summary for 2024\n\n**You\u2019re not sure you can fly your drone? You don\u2019t know which regulatory category it falls into?** Understanding the different flight categories and classifications is essential for professional drone pilots.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019re going to analyse the Open and Specific categories for you, clarifying their operational parameters and all the restrictions associated with them. Nevertheless, it\u2019s important to remember that airspace management is the responsibility of each European Member State, as is the establishment of airspace zones and the requirements for flying in them.\n\n## What is the open category?\n\nThe Open Category encompasses drone operations with minimal risk to individuals, property, and other aircraft. Primarily designed for recreational drone pilots, it comprises three subcategories\u2014**A1**, **A2**, and **A3**\u2014each adapted to various drone types and operational scenarios. Common to all subcategories are strict regulations, including:\n\n* **Prohibitions on flying over groups of uninvolved individuals**\n* **A maximum flight altitude of 120 meters above ground**\n* **The requirement for visual line of sight.**\n\n### SUBCATEGORY **A1**\n\nThe Open Category\u2019s A1 subcategory permits flying over uninvolved people, exclusively designated for drones equipped with identification tags C0 or C1. These drones posses a low-risk profile, although stringent precautions are still essential to mitigate potential incidents. A1-eligible drones must weigh a maximum of 900 grams and adhere to a maximum speed of 19m/s or 68 km/h.\n\n**C0 drones**, with a maximum weight of 250g, are allowed in both A1 and A3 categories, permitting flights over uninvolved individuals and within urban areas.\n\n**C1 drones**, with a maximum weight of 900g, are only permitted in A1 and A3 operations within urban areas, with the caveat that intentional flights over uninvolved individuals are strictly prohibited. Operations within the A1 category can fly close to or even above people with very light drones but are strictly prohibited from flying over groups of people.\n\n**C0 & C1 certified drones list** (not exhaustive)**:**\n\n* DJI Mini 2 SE / 3 / 3 Pro / 4 Pro **(C0)**\n* DJI Mavic 3 Classic **(C1)**\n* DJI Mavic 3 v2.0 **(C1)**\n* DJI Mavic 3 Cine v2.0 **(C1)**\n* DJI Air 3 **(C1)**\n\n## SUBCATEGORY **A2**\n\nSubcategory A2 within the Open Category imposes stricter requirements compared to A1. It permits flights with drones weighing up to 4 kilograms and includes prohibitions over sensitive sites, along with the necessity to maintain minimum safety distances from people and residential areas. Drone pilots operating within this category are mandated to fly within 30 meters of people or 5 meters if the low-speed mode is activated.\n\nIn addition to these regulations, A2 operations are exclusively designated for drones equipped with a label **C2**. Flying close to third parties is allowed in A2, with required horizontal distances set at 30 meters or flight altitude, or 5 meters when in low-speed mode.\n\n**C2 drones**, with a maximum weight of 4kg, are permitted in both A2 and A3 categories, enabling flights close to uninvolved people and within urban areas.\n\n**C2\u00a0certified drones list** (not exhaustive)**:**\n\n* DJI Mavic 3 Enterprise\n* DJI Mavic 3 Multispectral\n* DJI Mavic 3 Thermal\n* DJI Matrice M30 / Matrice M30T\n* AgEagle Sensefly eBee\n\n### SUBCATEGORY **A3**\n\nDesigned for higher-risk operations, Subcategory A3 permits drone flights with a take-off mass of up to 25 kilograms. Flying near people and vehicles is strictly prohibited, with a minimum safety distance of 150 meters required from unconcerned people.\n\nIn addition to these regulations, A3 operations are designated exclusively for drones equipped with C class labels C2, C3 and C4.\n\n**C3 & C4** drones are allowed only in A3 category flights, with a maximum weight of 25kg, and must maintain a minimum distance of 150 meters from urban areas and uninvolved individuals, including residential, commercial, industrial, and recreational areas.\n\n**C3\u00a0certified drones list** (not exhaustive)**:**\n\n* DJI Inspire 3\n* DJI M350 RTK\n* Quantum Trinity F90+\n* WingtraOne\n* Delair UX11 / UX11 Longue\n\n## What is the SPECIFIC category?\n\nThe EASA has established the Specific Category to regulate drone operations with higher levels of risk or complexity compared to those in the Open category. To operate within this category, there are four ways to obtain approval:\n\n**1.** Submission of a declaration according to **European Standard Scenarios (STS-01 / STS-02)**\n\n**2.** Obtaining a permit for a specific type of flight by submitting a **Pre-Defined Risk Assessment (PDRA)**\n\n**3.** Obtaining authorization for a specific type of flight by submitting a **Specific Operations Risk Assessment (SORA)**\n\n**4.** Obtaining a **Light UAS Operator Certificate (LUC)**\n\n[EASA - Operational Authorisation](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-rpas/specific-category-civil-drones/operational-authorisation)\n\n## What are standard scenarios (STS)?\n\nA standard scenario represents a pre-established operation, providing pilots different possibilities for their flights. Operators are not obligated to obtain operational authorization for STS operations. Therefore, it is essential to first determine if the operation can be accommodated under an STS.\n\nThere are two types of scenarios: **STS-01** and **STS-02**. The choice of scenario depends on the environment and type of missions in which you will operate your drone: urban areas, visual line of sight flights, beyond visual line of sight flights, controlled zones, etc.\n\nCommon features of flights under STS regulations include:\n\n* **Daytime flights are permitted, while night flights are strictly prohibited.**\n* **Drones with a wingspan less than 3 meters have the possibility to fly above controlled areas on the ground, whether in Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) or Visual Line of Sight (VLOS).**\n* **For drones with a wingspan less than 1 meter, flying over assemblies of people in VLOS is allowed, and BVLOS flights are possible above sparsely populated areas.**\n* **All flights are limited to a maximum height of 120 meters.**\n\n#### **STS-01** SCENARIO\n\nDesigned for operations with a low to medium level of risk, STS01 mandates the utilization of drones classified as **C5** class. These drones must adhere to a maximum speed of 5 m/s and maintain Visual Line of Sight (VLOS) during flight. Essentially, drones operating under STS01 regulations must stay within 120 meters from the ground, adjusted for terrain, and should not carry risky materials.\n\nAdditionally, the flight zone must be controlled on the ground if in a populated area. When flying near tall artificial obstacles, the maximum height can increase by up to 15 meters with permission.\n\nTo ensure compliance with STS01 regulations, drones must have the C5 class. Some C2/C3 drones (DJI Mavic 3, Inspire 3, Matrice 350) **may need to be upgraded using certified accessory/conversion kits that include a Flight Termination System (FTS) and a Parachute Recovery System (PRS).**\n\n### how to convert your drone into a C5 class ?\n\nIf your drone is a C2 model, you have the option to upgrade it to a C5 classification using a conversion kit. On the other hand, if it\u2019s a C3 model, you can achieve the C5 status with the use of an accessory kit.\n\nUsing Dronavia\u2019s conversion kit:\n\n* DJI Mavic 3 Enterprise **(C2)** = [Kronos AD Mavic 3E](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-dji-mavic-3/) **(C5)**\n* DJI Mavic 3 Thermal **(C2)** = Kronos AD Mavic 3T (C5)\n* DJI Mavic 3 Multispectral **(C2)** = Kronos AD Mavic 3M **(C5)**\n* DJI Mavic 3 Pro/Cine **(C2)** = Kronos Mavic 3 Pro Cine **(C5)**\n\nWith Dronavia\u2019s accessory kit:\n\n* DJI M350 RTK **(C3)** [is transformed into Matrice 350 RTK](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-dji-matrice-350/) **(C5)**\n* DJI Inspire 3 **(C3)** [is transformed into Inspire 3](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-dji-inspire-3/) **(C5)**\n\n[See the official list of C5 drones](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-rpas/open-category-civil-drones)\n\n#### **STS-02** scenario\n\nReserved for high-risk operations or those conducted in sensitive airspace, STS02 mandates the usage of a **C6** aircraft and comprehensive risk assessments, along with close coordination with air traffic control authorities. Similar to the STS-01 scenario, drones must stay within 120 meters from the ground, adjusting for terrain variations. However, BVLOS flights are only possible in ground-controlled areas and outside populated areas.\n\nFurthermore, drones operating under STS02 regulations must be C6 class and must not carry dangerous goods. A buffer zone, calculated based on the drone\u2019s characteristics and the Flight Termination System (FTS), must be maintained. The maximum flight distance is limited to 1 kilometer, and the drone must remain visible within 5 kilometers.\n\nIn cases where visibility is limited, or there is an absence of an aerial observer, a pre-programmed trajectory must be followed. However, if an aerial observer is present, the maximum flight distance extends to 2 kilometers.\n\n## How do I fly outside STS scenarios in a specific category?\n\nDepending on the risk of the operation to be carried out, the specific category does not offer pre-established requirements adapted to all operations. Each UAS operator must develop its own operational scenarios. This is a fundamental difference from the open category.\n\nThere are several ways of developing your own scenarios **(PDRA / SORA / LUC)** in order to fly outside the STS scenarios, but the methodology used is always that of the SORA. Here we present the SORA methodology and how it applies to these 3 methods.\n\n## what is a PDRA (**Pre-Defined Risk Assessment**)?\n\nIn the first instance, if the STS scenarios are not suitable for your mission, you will not have to resort immediately to a manual application. The intermediate stage is called Pre-Defined Risk Assessment (PDRA).\n\nIt is based on a large number of predefined missions which involve a higher risk than STS missions and which are frequently encountered in everyday life. In summary, PDRAs are pre-configured risk assessments based largely on the SORA methodology.\n\nThese PDRAs, are approved by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) as acceptable means of complying with Regulation 2019/947. We list some of them here:\n\n**PDRA-S: STS for uncertified drones**\n\nIf you want to fly a drone without a CE C5 or C6 class in an STS scenario, you can use a PDRA-S called **PDRA-S01 / PDRA-S02**.\n\n**PDRA-G: model for frequent missions**\n\nPDRA-Gs are structured in the same way as STSs, and differ only in the higher risks associated with the mission. The models that can be used are called **PDRA-G01 / PRDA-G02 / PDRA-G03.**\n\nEASA is already anticipating the future and is now working on the publication of new PDRAs to create new scenarios and facilitate access to them for professional telepilot :\n\n**PDRA-06:** Test operations for drones up to 8 metres, in areas where at least 50% of manned aviation can be detected.\n\n**PDRA-07:** Operations in the airport area to carry out inspections.\n\n**PDRA-08:** Drone swarm operations.\n\n## what is a SORA 2.5 (**Specific Operations Risk Assessment**)?\n\nIf your flight missions still do not correspond to any appropriate STS or PDRA, the SORA (Specific Operations Risk Assessment) solution is the best way to obtain authorisation. The SORA process was developed by an international forum made up of different safety and risk experts. The name of this organization is **JARUS (Joint Authorities for Rulemaking on Unmanned Systems).**\n\nThe SORA 2.5 method produces a value called **SAIL (Specific Assurance Integrity Level)**, which is the result of combining **the ground risk (GRC)**, **the air risk (ARC)** and the corresponding mitigation measures applied. Depending on the SAIL index obtained, the operation will be considered more or less risky:\n\n**Low risk (SAIL I and II)**  \n**Medium risk (SAIL III and IV)**  \n**High risk (SAIL V and VI)**\n\nOnce the risks have been defined, **the SORA 2.5 method indicates the minimum safety requirements that an operator must meet** in order to carry out the mission safely. The cost of developing a SORA application can range from \u20ac5,000 to \u20ac10,000.\n\n## what is the **operations manual (OM)**?\n\nAccording to Regulation (EU) 2019/947 an application for an operational authorisation in the specific category **must include an Operation Manual (OM),** together with the associated specific operations risk assessment (SORA), or a PDRA table if applicable, and the evidences of compliance.\n\nIf the operator\u2019s activity has already been declared (within his country) and he has an Operation Manual (OM) drawn up before 31/12/2020, then it can be considered as an Operation Manual (OM) within the meaning of European legislation. **All you need to do is complete this manual with the new specifics of the new regulation (EU 2019/947).**\n\nAs specialists in the immersive industry, we know that the drone is an essential tool. A well-written Operation Manual ensures safe and efficient flight operations. How to obtain an Operations Manual respecting the regulations in force as well as your operation? **Only one step: Fill out the form above (10 minutes)**\n\nAt the end of this step, we will send you the document and invite you to reread it to fully understand it.

We have a team of experts who master the complexities of drone regulations in France and Europe, offering a quality service that meets your specific needs.\n\nJordan Perrin\n\nInstructor and consultant, Immersive Ambition\n\n[create your operations manual (OM) easily](https://www.immersive-ambition.fr/en/manex)\n\n## What is IGRC (**INTRINSIC** **Ground Risk Class**) ?\n\n**INTRINSIC GROUND RISK CLASS**   \n**(Step #2 of SORA Methodology)**\n\nThe Ground Risk Class (GRC) is defined as the risk of a person being hit by a drone during a flight mission. To determine the intrinsic GRC , professional telepilots must take into account appendix F of the SORA 2.5 method, a table which takes into account the dimensions of the UAV, the maximum speed of the UAV and the population density present for the flight operation.\n\nOnce the initial intrinsic GRC has been determined, mitigation measures must be applied to reduce the risk and thus obtain the value of the final GRC.These mitigation measures are as follows:\n\n* There are effective engineered containment systems in place.\n* Systems that reduce the effects of the impact on people on the ground.\n* An effective emergency response plan is in place, available for use and has been validated.\n\n## What is FINAL GRC (**FINAL** **Ground Risk Class**) ?\n\n**FINAL GRC**  \n**(Step #3 of the SORA methodology)**\n\nAccording to this SORA methodology, the robustness of the mitigation measures is defined by the level of integrity offered by each of the mitigation measures and the level of assurance that the mitigation measures have achieved (for example, the method by which it is proven).\n\nThus, we find 3 types of robustness levels:\n\n**Low robustness**  \n**Medium robustness**  \n**High robustness**\n\nThus, depending on the robustness values of the mitigation measures applied, the GRC value can be reduced and the final GRC value obtained, always bearing in mind that it cannot be reduced below the minimum value in the resulting column of the \u201cUAS intrinsic ground risk class index\u201d table.\n\n## WHAT ARE MOC **(MEANS OF COMPLIANCE)** ?\n\nAn MoC (Means of Compliance) is a way for professional drone operators to demonstrate that they comply with the regulations and standards that apply to their activities, and to guarantee the quality and safety of the products they use. To obtain it, it is necessary to meet the current regulatory requirements published by EASA, the European Union\u2019s Aviation Safety Agency.\n\nIn addition to the quality and safety offered by a product that complies with the MOCs proposed by EASA, **professional drone operators can more easily obtain a SORA (Specific Operations Risk Assessment) or a PDRA (Pre-Defined Risk Assessment), flight authorisations issued for complex missions in a specific category.**\n\n\u201cAMCs are non-binding standards adopted by EASA to illustrate means to establish compliance with the Basic Regulation and its Implementing Rules.\n\nThe AMCs issued by EASA are not of a legislative nature. They cannot create additional obligations on the regulated persons, who may decide to show compliance with the applicable requirements using other means. However, as the legislator wanted such material to provide for legal certainty and to contribute to uniform implementation, it provided the AMC adopted by EASA with a presumption of compliance with the rules, so that it commits competent authorities to recognise regulated persons complying with EASA AMC as complying with the law.\u201d\n\n[Definition by EASA](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/acceptable-means-compliance-amcs-and-alternative-means-compliance-altmocs)\n\n### how to REDUCE FINAL GRC with **MOC2512 (M2)**?\n\nAs professional telepilots, it is important to be aware of the means of compliance for M2 mitigations of medium robustness, enabling you to reduce your final GRC score during the SORA application.\n\nMOC2512 (M2) designates the level of robustness required for the safety system in the event of a drone losing control and falling to the ground. To achieve this, the safety system must :\n\nReduce the effect of ground impact  \nOperate reliably in the event of loss of control  \nNot introduce any additional risk\n\nDronavia\u2019s Kronos Parachute Recovery Systems (PRS) for [DJI Inspire 3](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-dji-inspire-3/) and [Matrice 300/350](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-dji-matrice-350/) as well as for [DJI Mavic 3](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-dji-mavic-3/) comply with MOC25-12 (M2) published by the EASA and therefore reduce the final GRC score by one point.\n\n**To benefit from this score reduction, Dronavia is able to provide all the necessary proof (declaration of conformity, test reports, etc.) requested by the national authority and/or the EASA.**\n\n### how to complete part 8 \u00a0 with **MOC2511** ?\n\nStep 8 (Containment Requirements) of the SORA 2.5 discusses the risk of losing control of the aircraft and flying into adjacent areas where the risk to third parties (on the ground or in the air) may be greater. If the aircraft is not adequately designed, there may be probable reasons that could lead to an exit from the area of operation.\n\nThe operator must take into account a matrix which combines the SAIL and the final GRC of the adjacent area, explained in appendix E of the SORA 2.5. For any reinforced containment system, the operator must: \u201cdeclare compliance with the provisions of the document \u201cMeans of compliance with Light UAS.2511 \u2013 Reinforced containment\u201d, or provide proof of this compliance (technical description, test reports, etc.) when applying for a permit. \u201c\n\nThe Dronavia flight termination systems (FTS) of the Kronos range for [DJI Inspire 3](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronons-fts-inspire3/) and [Matrice 300/350](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-fts-matrice350/) as well as for [DJI Mavic 3](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/zephyr-fts-mavic3/) are compliant with MOC25-11 published by EASA and allow compliance with step 8 during the SORA application.\n\n**To benefit from this compliance, Dronavia is able to provide all the necessary evidence (declaration of conformity, test reports, ground risk buffer, etc.) requested by the national authority and/or the EASA.**\n\n## what is a LUC **(Light UAS Operator Certificate)**?\n\nThe latest solution is aimed at all users who have to submit activity reports for a well-defined type of operation on a very regular basis.\n\nLUC stands for Light UAS Operator Certificate and means that you are particularly familiar with the risks and safety measures to be applied for a specific type of drone operation. If you obtain an LUC, you can :\n\n* **Operate in standard scenarios without declaring it**\n* **Operate in PDRA without approval**\n* **Conduct the SORA process and related operations without authorization**\n\n# C5 CLASS\n\nfor your DJI Matrice 350\n\n[more informations](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-dji-matrice-350/)\n\n# C5 CLASS\n\nfor your DJI Inspire 3\n\n[more informations](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-dji-inspire-3/)\n\n# C5 CLASS\n\nfor your DJI Mavic 3\n\n[more informations](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-dji-mavic-3/)\n\nmore articles\n\n## [Procedure for converting a C2/C5 drone: What you need to know](https://www.dronavia.com/2025/12/05/procedure-converting-c2-c5-drone/)\n\nDec 5, 2025\n\nProcedure for converting a C2/C5 drone: What you need to know Many professional pilots are...\n\n## [Kronos MVC3 \u2013 Manufacturer Maintenance Campaign](https://www.dronavia.com/2025/10/03/kronos-mvc3-maintenance/)\n\nOct 3, 2025\n\npress release: Kronos MVC3 manufacturer maintenance campaign Dronavia announces the official...\n\n## [Drone DJI C2 / C5 sur AlphaTango : Processus d\u00e9claratif & contraintes](https://www.dronavia.com/2025/06/02/c2-c5-conversion-kit/)\n\nJun 2, 2025\n\nDRONES DJI : CONVERSION C2/C5 : PROCESSUS D\u00c9CLARATIF ET CONTRAINTES \u00a0De nombreux pilotes...\n\n## [Dronavia & DJI: a long story](https://www.dronavia.com/2025/01/07/dronavia-dji-a-long-story/)\n\nJan 7, 2025\n\nDronavia & DJI: a long story Dronavia has officially joined the DJI Eco Partner ecosystem, an...\n\n## [Dronavia officially becomes DJI Eco Partner](https://www.dronavia.com/2025/01/07/dji-eco-partner/)\n\nJan 7, 2025\n\ndronavia officially becomes a DJI Eco Partner Dronavia is proud to announce its official...\n\n## [INTERVIEW \uff5cThe very first STS-01 (EASA) telepilot in Austria](https://www.dronavia.com/2024/09/19/first-sts-01-telepilot/)\n\nSep 19, 2024\n\nThe very first STS-01 telepilot in Austria: The interview Raffel Portugal was lucky enough to...\n\n## [How can I update my Fly ID system from my web interface?](https://www.dronavia.com/2024/06/06/update-fly-id-system/)\n\nJun 6, 2024\n\nFly ID update available: Get remote dual identification (FR/EU) How can I update my Fly ID system...\n\n## [Remote dual identification (FR/EU) : Understanding everything](https://www.dronavia.com/2024/05/14/double-identification/)\n\nMay 14, 2024\n\nFly ID and Zephyr Beacon update available: Get remote dual identification (FR/EU)UPDATE FLY ID /...\n\n## [European exclusivity : Get C5 class for DJI Mavic 3 drone](https://www.dronavia.com/2024/04/11/c5-class-for-dji-mavic-3-enterprise-pro/)\n\nApr 11, 2024\n\nEUROPEAN EXCLUSIVITY : GET C5 CLASS FOR DJI MAVIC 3 (ENTERPRISE/PRO/PRO CINE) Dronavia is proud to...\n\nShare This\n\n ",

Discover certification requirements and international operation guidelines.\n\nEuropean drone operations require strict compliance with European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) regulations that have fundamentally transformed how commercial and recreational drone pilots operate across EU member states. The complexity of these regulations creates significant challenges for operators who must understand classification systems, certification requirements, and operational limitations that vary based on drone weight, mission type, and geographic location.\n\nEASA drone regulations establish comprehensive frameworks that harmonize drone operations across 27 EU member states while ensuring aviation safety and public protection. Professional drone operators must navigate complex certification processes, operational limitations, and administrative requirements that affect everything from equipment selection to mission planning and pilot training.\n\nEuropean drone laws continue evolving as EASA adapts regulations to technological advances and operational experience while balancing safety requirements with industry growth and innovation needs. These regulatory changes require continuous monitoring and adaptation by professional operators who must maintain compliance while serving clients across multiple European jurisdictions.\n\n## Current Regulation Overview\n\n### Regulatory Framework Structure\n\nThe European Union drone regulation framework, established through Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/947 and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/945, creates unified standards across all EU member states. Professional operators must understand that these regulations supersede national drone laws and establish consistent requirements for certification, operations, and equipment across the European Union.\n\nThree operational categories define regulatory requirements based on risk assessment: Open, Specific, and Certified categories that determine certification requirements, operational limitations, and administrative obligations. Professional operators must correctly classify their operations to ensure appropriate compliance procedures and avoid regulatory violations.\n\nCE marking requirements mandate that drones sold in the European Union meet specific safety and performance standards established by EASA regulations. Professional operators must verify that their equipment carries appropriate CE markings and meets regulatory requirements for their intended operational category.\n\nTransitional provisions established in EASA regulations allow existing operators to continue operations under certain conditions while adapting to new requirements, but these provisions have specific timelines and limitations. Professional operators must understand transition deadlines and ensure compliance with new requirements before exemption periods expire.\n\n### Open Category Operations\n\nClass identification requirements mandate that drones used in Open category operations display appropriate class markings (C0-C6) that correspond to their technical specifications and operational limitations. Professional operators must verify that their equipment meets class requirements and displays appropriate markings for legal operations.\n\nSubcategory limitations within Open operations (A1, A2, A3) establish specific operational restrictions including maximum weights, altitude limits, and proximity to people that vary based on drone class and pilot qualifications. Professional operators must understand which subcategory applies to their operations and comply with corresponding limitations.\n\nRemote pilot competency requirements vary by Open subcategory, with A1/A3 operations requiring online training and competency demonstration while A2 operations require additional theoretical knowledge and practical skill demonstration. Professional pilots must obtain appropriate certifications before conducting operations in their intended subcategory.\n\nOperational limitations in Open category include maximum altitude restrictions, visual line of sight requirements, and prohibitions on operations over crowds or near airports without authorization. Professional operators must understand these limitations and plan missions accordingly to maintain regulatory compliance.\n\n### Specific Category Operations\n\nRisk assessment procedures require Specific category operators to conduct Specific Operations Risk Assessment (SORA) or demonstrate compliance with Standard Scenarios (STS) that establish operational limitations and mitigation measures. Professional operators must complete appropriate risk assessment processes and implement required safety measures.\n\nAuthorization requirements mandate that Specific category operations receive approval from national aviation authorities before commencement, with applications requiring detailed operational documentation and safety case development. Professional operators must allow adequate time for authorization processes and provide comprehensive documentation.\n\nStandard Scenarios provide pre-defined operational parameters for common Specific category operations including visual line of sight (STS-01) and beyond visual line of sight (STS-02) operations with specific limitations and requirements. Professional operators may use Standard Scenarios to streamline authorization processes for qualifying operations.\n\nOperational safety objectives establish specific safety targets that Specific category operations must achieve through appropriate mitigation measures and operational procedures. Professional operators must demonstrate how their operations meet required safety objectives through risk assessment and mitigation implementation.\n\n## Compliance Checklist and Procedures\n\n### Pre-Operation Compliance Requirements\n\nDrone registration obligations require operators conducting Specific category operations or Open category operations with drones heavier than 250 grams to register with national aviation authorities. Professional operators must complete registration processes and display registration numbers on their aircraft before conducting operations.\n\nInsurance requirements mandate appropriate liability coverage for commercial drone operations, with minimum coverage amounts specified by EASA regulations and national implementations. Professional operators must maintain adequate insurance coverage and provide documentation as required by operational authorizations.\n\nPilot certification verification ensures that remote pilots hold appropriate certificates for their intended operations, including theoretical knowledge demonstration and practical skill assessment.

Whether you\u2019re a hobbyist, commercial operator, or policymaker, staying informed on current and emerging drone laws is crucial. With developments in autonomous flight, AI-powered operations, and real-time data, updated policies are essential for legal compliance and operational success.\n\nIn this article, we will break down drone legislation, from existing practices to new updates, and what to expect in the following years. The article will also cover drone laws and policies, compliance tips, global regulations, and the vital question: What are the current drone laws? It is already half of the year, yet staying informed has never been more critical.\n\n## Why Understanding Drone Laws Is Essential in 2025\n\nLike any other aerial operation, deploying a drone comes with a legal responsibility. Now that more industries are relying on drone operations in their everyday work, adhering to the rules and regulations is a must.\n\nSo, whether you are a professional drone pilot, a hobbyist, or a drone manufacturer, here are some of the reasons why staying updated is crucial:\n\n* Practice legal and proper drone flights to avoid penalties and airspace violations.\n* Securing everyone\u2019s privacy and maintaining public trust.\n* Building a drone business\u2019s credibility by complying with drone regulations.\n* Availability for international operations with enough knowledge of global drone laws.\n* Creating and adapting to new frameworks and drone law updates.\n* Learning the essentials as governments worldwide are tightening national drone laws.\n\nHaving sufficient knowledge and awareness of drone laws worldwide enables operators and companies to adjust their drones and flights, thereby reducing risks and future concerns.\n\n## **Current Landscape of Drone Laws (2023\u20132024 Overview)**\n\nUnderstanding the evolution of drone laws from 2023 to 2024 provides insight into the current rules and regulations. So, what were these policies in the past years? Here are some of the following, in the:\n\n**Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the United States:**\n\n* They were able to enforce a remote ID rule for drone identification.\n* They strengthened their [BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line of Sight)](https://www.zenatech.com/drone-laws-2025-everything-you-need-to-know/) rules and pilot programs.\n* They implement a regulation requiring drones over 250 grams to be registered.\n* They also require that the commercial operators have a Part 107 certification.\n\n**European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA):**\n\n* They presented U-Space regulations for handling urban drone traffic.\n* They also updated SORA (Specific Operations Risk Assessment) to version 2.5.\n* The union also introduced certified pathways for drones that weigh up to 600 kg.\n\n**Transport Canada:**\n\n* They divided their drone operations into basic and advanced categories.\n* They also required registering drones that weigh between 250 grams and 25 kg.\n* They implement a Mandated Special Flight Operations Certificate for complex drone missions.\n\nThese are just some of the drone regulation updates; these may vary depending on the countries and their national laws.\n\n## Common Categories in Drone Laws and Policies (Globally)\n\nHere is a short table on the usual categories in developing drone laws around the world.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Category** | **Description** |\n| Registration | Drone laws may vary depending on the national or local policy on what weight or purpose requires registration. |\n| Airspace Restrictions | Focusing on the airspace restrictions for drone flights in specific locations, such as airports, military areas, or large public gatherings. |\n| Privacy Regulations | It ensures that drone operators avoid unauthorized flights and the gathering of visual data. |\n| Operator Certification | Ensuring safe operations, drone pilots must pass regulatory exams and/or have their license, depending on their purpose and local drone laws. |\n| Insurance and Liability | To cover any future risks, every drone operation should be insured and held liable. |\n\n## What Are The Changes Over Time?\n\nIn between these years, here are some of the several changes that happened in drone laws:\n\n* Many regions have mandated a remote ID system.\n* BVLOS operations have acquired traction with pilot programs.\n* New [traffic management systems](https://www.zenatech.com/traffic-management/) have emerged due to urban air mobility initiatives.\n\nThese developments are just some of the factors that pushed drone law updates in 2025.\n\n## What Are Drone Law Trends in 2025?\n\nAs the year began, the drone market and drone users continued to rise. One of its innovations that pushes the industry to another level is the use of autonomous aerial operations. Consequently, global regulatory bodies are also evolving drone laws and policies.\n\nHere are some predicted legal changes that help policymakers address the transitions of drones, which involve issues such as address, safety, privacy, and international harmonization.\n\n### Expanded No-Fly Zones\n\nIncreased drone activity near sensitive areas \u2014 including government buildings, hospitals, disaster zones, and protected heritage sites \u2014 is prompting tighter restrictions.\n\n* U.S. Example: The FAA expanded restricted zones around federal facilities, chemical plants, and significant sporting events using geofencing and Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) advisories.\n* European Example: EASA advised temporary airspace closures around high-security events like G7 summits and UEFA stadiums.\n\n### Automated Flight Regulations\n\nDrone operations in BVLOS require a legal framework to ensure collision avoidance and command accountability.\n\n* U.S. Example: The FAA launched BVLOS ARC (Aviation Rulemaking Committee) recommendations in early 2025 for scaled autonomous deliveries and remote piloting.\n* Europe Example: EASA updated SORA 2.5 with AI risk modules for autonomous drones in shared airspace.\n\n### Privacy Protections\n\nUnregulated drone surveillance has raised ethical and legal concerns in residential zones and commercial centers.\n\n* U.S. Policy Shift: States like California and New York introduced drone-specific privacy laws prohibiting facial recognition and audio capture without consent.\n* Europe Context: GDPR-compliant drone operations must anonymize or minimize the collection of personal data. Breaching this policy may result in a hefty fine.\n\n### UTM Systems (Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management)\n\nWith increased drone traffic, centralized coordination systems are necessary for airspace safety.\n\n* U.S. Progress: NASA and the FAA\u2019s UTM Pilot Program entered operational testing across major cities, integrating drones with traditional ATC.\n* Europe\u2019s Approach: U-Space Services under EASA are mandatory for certain urban drone flights, especially in controlled and congested environments.\n\n## Global Standardization vs. Local Sovereignty\n\nCross-border drone operations and international logistics demand harmonized rules, while national defense and privacy concerns require tailored laws.\n\nIn the international frameworks, ICAO and [NATO](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2017/07/28/autonomous-military-drones-no-longer-science-fiction/index.html) published interoperability guidelines for commercial and defense-grade drones.\n\nDespite global efforts, there are also regional conflicts. Countries like Germany and France maintain strict sovereign oversight over drones operating near sensitive borders.\n\n## 2025 FAA Guidelines for Drone Pilots\n\n[Legal drone operations](https://www.zenatech.com/different-types-of-drones-and-their-uses/) involve understanding the latest guidelines for drone operation. So, whatever the reason for your drone flight\u2014recreation or business\u2014here is the updated FAA things to remember for all drone operators.\n\n### Drone Registration Rules\n\n* **Weight**: Drones weighing more than 0.55 pounds (250 grams) are required to be registered with the FAA through the [FAADroneZone](https://faadronezone-access.faa.gov/).\n* **Fees**: Each drone should be registered for $5, valid for three years.\n* **Labels**: The drone must visibly display its FAA registration number.\n* **Remote ID Requirements**: All drones flying in unrestricted areas must comply with the FAA.\n\n### Remote ID regulations:\n\n* Drones must broadcast location and identification data.\n* Drones without built-in Remote ID must use an external broadcast module, unless operating in an approved FAA-recognized Identification Area (FRIA).\n\n### Limitations on Altitude\n\n* Drones **cannot fly above 400 feet** to avoid interfering with crewed aircraft.\n* Exceptions may be granted for **authorized commercial activities** with specific FAA permission.\n* Drone pilots must understand the policy under airspace restrictions, where they must apply for a waiver or have **performance-based approvals**, as it is vital to drone capabilities.\n\n### Reliable Airspace Awareness\n\n* Drone operators must avoid restricted areas, which usually include the airways, military headquarters, and national parks.\n* It is also commendable to use the FAA B4UFLY app to identify no-fly zones.\n* Monitor NOTAMs (Notices to Air Missions) for temporary flight restrictions during events, emergencies, or VIP movements.\n\n### Visual Line of Sight Requirement\n\n* At all times, a drone pilot must maintain a direct visual line of sight from their drone.\n* During night operations, it is a requirement for a drone to come with approved anti-collision lights.\n* FPV (First-Person View) flying is allowed only when a visual observer is present to maintain situational awareness.\n\n### Pilot Certification & Training\n\nAll drone pilots flying under Part 107 must complete recurrent training, which now includes emergency procedures, UAS maintenance protocols, and updates on remote ID and airspace access.\n\nNote that these guidelines apply to drone operations in the United States. Drone laws around the world may have different rules and regulations. For that reason, get to know more of some of the known regulatory bodies in the drone industry.\n\n## Legal Drone Operations: Key Regulatory Bodies and Their Roles\n\nUnderstanding who sets and enforces drone legislation is essential for compliance. In 2025, several key organizations are leading the charge in shaping national drone laws and influencing global drone laws. Get to know more about them here.\n\n### Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) \u2013 United States\n\nThe United States has the FAA to govern all civil aviation. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) are one of them. They set the standards and regulations for registration, pilot certification, airspace access, and safety protocols.\n\n**2025 Highlights:**\n\n* Expanded Remote ID enforcement for all drones over 250g.\n* BVLOS ARC recommendations adopted for autonomous operations.\n* Integration of drones into controlled airspace via [LAANC](https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/laanc) and UTM systems.\n* Updated Part 107 rules for commercial drone operators.\n\nDrone operators in the United States are required to follow the FAA rules, as they may face consequences such as fines or license suspension. In addition, the FAA\u2019s decisions often influence international standards due to its global leadership.\n\n### **European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)**\n\nEU member states are overseen by the [EASA](https://european-union.europa.eu/institutions-law-budget/institutions-and-bodies/search-all-eu-institutions-and-bodies/european-union-aviation-safety-agency-easa_en), which oversees aviation operations, including those involving drone technology. The EASA provides unified regulations through the EU drone regulation framework.\n\n**2025 Highlights:**\n\n* Mandatory U-Space services for urban drone flights.\n* Updated SORA 2.5 risk assessment for autonomous drones.\n* Certification pathways for drones up to 600 kg.\n* Harmonized privacy and data protection standards under GDPR.\n\nA legal drone operation in the EU means operators must register their drones, obtain pilot credentials, and follow U-Space protocols. EASA\u2019s unified approach simplifies cross-border drone operations within Europe.\n\n### Transport Canada\n\nTransport Canada regulates drone operations in Canada, balancing innovation with safety and privacy.\n\n**2025 Highlights:**\n\n* Streamlined registration for drones under 25 kg.\n* Updated pilot certification for advanced operations.\n* Introduced new insurance requirements for commercial flights.\n\nCanadian operators must follow Basic or Advanced operation rules, depending on mission complexity. Transport Canada\u2019s policies often mirror FAA and EASA standards.\n\n### International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)\n\nICAO sets global aviation standards and promotes harmonization of drone laws around the world. It collaborates with national authorities to ensure the safe integration of drones into international airspace.\n\n**2025 Highlights:**\n\n* Published global UAS interoperability guidelines.\n* Advocated for standardized Remote ID and [BVLOS frameworks](https://enterprise-insights.dji.com/blog/detailed-overview-of-north-america-bvlos-regulations-for-remote-drone-operations).\n* Supported cross-border drone logistics and humanitarian missions.\n\nICAO\u2019s recommendations influence national policies and help align drone law updates across countries. Operators involved in international missions must follow ICAO protocols.\n\n## **Future Outlook \u2014 What Drone Laws May Look Like in 2030**\n\nAs drone technology becomes embedded in daily life, drone legislation will evolve to address new challenges and opportunities. By 2030, drones may be as common as smartphones \u2014 used for deliveries, inspections, surveillance, and even passenger transport.\n\nSo what should we expect? Here are some of them:\n\n* Autonomous Operations as the Norm\n* Urban Air Mobility (UAM) Integration\n* AI and Machine Learning Regulation\n* Global Harmonization of Drone Laws\n* Smart City Integration\n\nAlthough no one knows what the future holds, it is an apparent fact that future drone laws can be more complex yet comprehensive, given the continuous evolution and upgrading of technology, which enhances their capabilities.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhat are the current drone laws? Answering this question reveals that the drone industry is still thriving in 2025. And with its ever-growing advancements, using this technology comes with a great responsibility. As we\u2019ve explored throughout this guide, understanding and complying with drone laws, both locally and globally, is essential for safe, ethical, and legal operations.\n\nDiscover more about drone laws and operations with [ZenaTech](https://www.zenatech.com/), ensuring you fully comply to enjoy the benefits of drone solutions.\n\n ",

All operators must now ensure their systems are fully compliant with these active regulations. This blog post focuses on the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) regulations that govern all drone operations across EU member states, as well as Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein.\n\n## **EASA drone operator registration requirements**\n\nBefore diving into Remote ID specifics, let\u2019s clarify when drone operators must register with their country\u2019s National Aviation Authority (NAA). Understanding who qualifies as a \u201cdrone operator\u201d is crucial for compliance. The \u201cdrone operator\u201d is the person or entity that owns or rents the drone.\n\nRegistration is exempted only if your drone meets one of these criteria:\n\n* Weighs less than 250 grams (including payload) and has no camera or sensor capable of capturing personal data.\n* Weighs less than 250 grams (including payload) and is classified as a toy under\u00a0[Directive 2009/48/EC](https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/sectors/toys/toy-safety_en)\u00a0(intended for children under 14).\n\nOnce registered, drone operators receive a unique operator registration number valid throughout the entire EU. This number must be physically displayed on all drones using a sticker and entered into each operational drone\u2019s Remote ID system.\n\nPro Tips*Keep your registration current and ensure the operator number is clearly visible on every aircraft. This single registration provides cross-border operational privileges across all EASA member states.*\n\n## **The EASA Drone Classification Scheme ID**\n\nEASA classifies drones based on multiple factors, including weight, capability, and operational risk. The system consists of classes and categories that work together to define compliance requirements. Similar to CE markings on consumer products, drone classes indicate the technical specifications and safety features built into the aircraft:\n\n* C0: Under 250g\n* C1: Under 900g with specific safety features\n* C2: Under 4kg with enhanced capabilities\n* C3: Under 25kg\n* C4: Under 25kg without automatic control (traditional model aircraft)\n* C5 and C6: Specific category operations with certification requirements\n\nThe three operational categories, Open, Specific, and Certified, are based on risk assessment:\n\n* Open category: Low-risk operations, typically for hobbyists and basic commercial use. No prior authorization is required, but strict limits apply, including maintaining Visual Line of Sight (VLOS), altitude restrictions, and limitations on proximity to people. The Open category has three subcategories: A1 (over people with restrictions), A2 (near people with a safe distance), and A3 (far from people).\n* Specific category: Moderate-risk operations that fall outside the Open category (most commercial BVLOS flights) require a risk assessment ([SORA](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/drones-air-mobility/operating-drone/specific-category-civil-drones/specific-operations-risk-assessment-sora)\u00a0or\u00a0[PDRA](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/drones-air-mobility/operating-drone/specific-category-civil-drones/predefined-risk-assessment-pdra)) or declaration for Standard scenarios and operational authorization from the national aviation authority (NAA). Remote ID functionality is mandatory.\n* Certified Category: High-risk operations, such as urban air mobility, passenger transport, dangerous goods transport, and complex urban operations. This category requires full certification, similar to manned aviation, including certified drones, licensed pilots, operator approval, and comprehensive safety systems.\n\nPro Tips*Most commercial drone operations fall into either the Open A3 subcategory (far from people) or the Specific category. Understanding which applies to your mission is essential for compliance planning.*\n\n## **What Is the EASA\u2019s Remote ID Regulation (2025)?**\n\nSince January 1, 2024, Remote ID has been mandatory across EASA jurisdictions for most drone operations. Here\u2019s what you need to know about compliance.\n\n**What Is Remote ID?**\n\nThink of Remote ID as a digital license plate for your drone. It broadcasts identification information that authorities and the public can receive via smartphone applications, enhancing airspace safety and accountability.\n\n**Which Drones Require Remote ID?**\n\nRemote ID is required for all drones operating in the Specific category and all drones with class marks (C1, C2, C3, C5, C6) operating in the Open category.\n\nThe following drones are exempt from Remote ID requirements:\n\n* Class C0 drones: Maximum take-off weight under 250g, including payload.\n* Tethered C3 drones: Must weigh less than 25kg, be electrically powered, attached to a tether under 50 meters, equipped with geo-awareness, and have low battery alerts.\n* Class C4 drones: Under 25kg with no automatic control modes except flight stabilization (intended for traditional model aircraft enthusiasts).\n\nEASA has adopted Direct Remote ID, also known as\u00a0[Broadcast Remote ID](https://www.elsight.com/remote-id/), as the current implementation method. This one-way broadcast system doesn\u2019t require internet connectivity and can be received by anyone with appropriate equipment in the vicinity.\n\nDrones can comply through built-in functionality or add-on modules. Both options must broadcast continuously during flight using open, documented protocols (non-ADS-B or Automatic Dependent Surveillance). The required broadcast data transmission must include:\n\n* UAS operator registration number (with verification)\n* Unique serial number of the drone\n* Real-time geographical position and height above the surface or take-off point\n* Heading and ground speed\n* Geographical position of the operator or take-off point\n* Emergency status indicator\n* Timestamp\n\nThe drone system must prevent modification of all data except the operator registration number, ensuring data integrity.\n\nPro Tips*When selecting a Remote ID add-on module, verify that it meets EASA requirements. Not all modules meet the strict European requirements.*\n\n## **How are BVLOS operations classified under the EASA Regulation?**\n\n[BVLOS](https://www.elsight.com/bvlos/)\u00a0(beyond visual line of sight) drone operations require special consideration under EASA rules. All drones in the Open category must be operated within Visual Line of Sight (VLOS), meaning BVLOS flights automatically fall under either the Specific or Certified categories.\n\nThe Specific category BVLOS operations require compliance with either:\n\n* Standard Scenarios (STS): Pre-defined scenarios with declared compliance, which include STS-01 (VLOS operations over controlled ground area) and STS-02 (BVLOS with airspace observers over controlled ground area). As of August 30, 2024, operators can no longer submit national standard scenario (STS-ES) declarations of conformity in many member states.\n* Individual Risk Assessment: A case-by-case authorization using\u00a0[SORA](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/drones-air-mobility/operating-drone/specific-category-civil-drones/specific-operations-risk-assessment-sora)\u00a0(Specific Operations Risk Assessment) and\u00a0[PDRA](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/drones-air-mobility/operating-drone/specific-category-civil-drones/predefined-risk-assessment-pdra)\u00a0(Pre-Defined Risk Assessment).\n\nThe Certified category applies to the highest-risk BVLOS operations, including urban air mobility (UAM), package delivery in populated areas, passenger transport, dangerous goods transport, and operations over assemblies of people. These operations require the same level of oversight as manned aviation, including certified aircraft, licensed pilots, and comprehensive safety management systems.\n\nPro Tips*Most commercial BVLOS applications, such as inspections, surveys, and agricultural monitoring, operate under the Specific category. Start your authorization process early\u2014obtaining approvals can take several months.*\n\n## **Network Remote ID: The Future of European Drone Connectivity**\n\nWhile Direct Remote ID is currently mandated, EASA is actively developing Network Remote ID requirements as part of the broader U-space initiative. U-space is a set of services and digital infrastructure defined by EASA and the EU to coordinate drones in low-altitude airspace, ensuring safe access while enabling commercial, industrial, and public-safety drone operations to scale.\n\nNetwork Remote ID transmits drone identification information to centralized service providers via internet connectivity, enabling tracking over longer distances, integration with air traffic management systems, coordination of complex missions in shared airspace, and enhanced situational awareness for authorities.\n\nNetwork Remote ID is mandatory for participation in U-space, Europe\u2019s UTM (Unmanned Traffic Management) system for safely and efficiently\u00a0managing drone traffic. U-space only applies in designated U-space airspace, which individual EU states activate when needed. As U-space zones expand across Europe, operators will need solutions that support both Direct and Network Remote ID.\n\nPro Tips*While Network Remote ID isn\u2019t yet universally mandated, selecting connectivity solutions that support both broadcast and network capabilities ensures you\u2019re prepared for evolving regulations.*\n\n## **Elsight\u2019s Halo: Robust BVLOS Connectivity and Remote ID for EASA-Compliant Operations**\n\nCompliance with EASA regulations requires more than just Remote ID. It demands reliable, redundant connectivity that keeps your operations safe and your data flowing. Elsight\u2019s\u00a0[Halo BVLOS communication module](https://www.elsight.com/products/allsight-drone-cloud-management-platform/heatsight-visualizing-connectivity/)\u00a0includes multilink operation that aggregates up to four cellular channels, SATcom, and other RF links into a single virtual tunnel, with advanced traffic monitoring, load balancing, and seamless handoff capabilities.

Exemptions apply only to C0 drones, C4 model aircraft, and specific tethered C3 systems.\n* U-space provides digital air traffic services for drones in designated airspace and requires Network Remote ID.\n* Elsight\u2019s Halo BVLOS communication module provides robust connectivity with built-in Remote ID functionality, supporting multilink, secure, BVLOS-ready connectivity.\n\n**FAQs**\n\n1. **Which drones need Remote ID under EASA regulations?**\n\nMost drones operating in the Open (C1\u2013C3) and Specific (C5\u2013C6) categories require Direct Remote ID. Exemptions apply only to C0 drones weighing less than 250g, C4 model aircraft, and some tethered C3 drones that meet strict technical conditions.\n\n1. **What approvals are required for BVLOS operations in the Specific category?**\n\nBVLOS operations under the Specific category require a Standard Scenario declaration (STS-02) or an operational authorization based on a SORA or PDRA. Approval timelines vary and may take several months.\n\n1. **What is the difference between Direct Remote ID and Network Remote ID?**\n\nDirect Remote ID broadcasts drone identification locally during flight. Network Remote ID sends identification data to service providers via network connectivity. Direct Remote ID is mandatory today, while Network Remote ID will be required for operations inside U-space airspace\n\nTo find out more about how Halo can help you develop your EASA-compliant BVLOS drone platform, please get in touch!\n\n**Related resources**\n\n* [Remote ID for Drones & UAV\u2019s: Ensuring Safety in the Sky](https://www.elsight.com/blog/internal-review-on-remote-id/)\n* [Compliance with FAA Remote ID Regulations](https://www.elsight.com/remote-id/faa-compliance/)\n* [Unlocking the Potential of Remote ID for the Drone Industry](https://www.elsight.com/blog/unlocking-the-potential-of-remote-id-for-the-drone-industry/)\n* [The FAA\u2019s overview of Remote ID regulations for drone pilots](https://www.elsight.com/remote-id/faa-compliance/)\n\nContact Us\n\nAwesome **resources**\n\n[Elsight\u2019s Halo Awarded through U.S. Defense Innovation Unit\u2019s (DIU) Project GI for Reliable Connectivity in Contested Domains\n\nReading time: 2 minutesElsight Selected by the DIU of the Department of War (DOW) for Phase 3 of Project G.I.

It contains all the important information that drone pilots need to know if they want to fly legally with their drone. In addition to this, the individual countries can still add their own regulations, but they are all based on the EU laws.\n\nOn the following page we provide you with an overview of the current EU drone laws 2024 with all the important information that is relevant for drone pilots. Individual sub-areas are also addressed in more detail in separate articles. In this way, we want to keep the article as comprehensive and yet as lean as possible.\n\nPlease note: The information on this page has been compiled to the best of our knowledge and is partly freely translated. Many texts are currently still available as drafts and/or in English. Should there be any changes to the regulations before or after the official launch, we will of course update this page.\n\n## New EU Drone Regulation 2024 \u2013 what has changed?\n\nWith the introduction of the EU Drone Regulation at the end of 2020, the laws surrounding unmanned air traffic were standardized within the EU \u2013 as far as possible. This inevitably led to deviations in the drone regulation from 2017 that was valid in Germany until then.\n\n* Increase of the maximum flight altitude from 100m to 120m\n* Adjustment of weight limits\n* Registration of drone pilots\n* Introduction of two different drone pilot certificates (EU certificate of competence and EU remote pilot certificate\n* eID for drones\n\nThe EU Drone Regulation is additionally structured as follows:\n\n* Classification of drones into classes (C0 \u2013 C5)\n* Classification into application scenarios (Open, Specific, Certified)\n\nThe following paragraphs describe the above points in detail.\n\n## Application scenarios of the EU Drone Regulation 2024\n\nEach drone flight is classified into one of three categories based on its characteristics: Open, Specific and Certified. The Open category is further subdivided into three subcategories A1, A2 and A3. If a drone flight cannot be assigned to any subcategory of the Open category, it automatically slips into the Specific category. If the application is not covered there either, the highest classification is reached, the Certified class.\n\nFor most hobby pilots, the Open category will apply most often, while commercial drone pilots will have to distinguish between Open and Specific. The Certified category will play little role for most drone pilots and will likely apply mostly only to industrial companies such as drone delivery services and similar businesses.\n\n## Use Case Scenario: Open\n\n* No permits necessary\n* Compulsory insurance for all drone pilots\n* Low risk drone flights\n* Flight only allowed within visual range\n* No transport of dangerous goods\n* No dropping of objects\n* Depending on subcategory/drone class Online training\u2026\n* \u2026drone pilot license\u2026\n* \u2026or registration of the drone pilot necessary\n* Minimum age may be chosen by each member state. In Germany it is 16 years, except for toy drones according to directive 2009/48/EC (drones under 250g without camera or sensors for recording) for which there is no age classification\n* A drone license plate with EU registration number (eID) of the drone pilot is required. Except for toy drones (drones under 250g and without recording function).\n* In addition, there are regulations of the respective EU member state. For example, they themselves may define so-called \u201cNo Fly Zones\u201d (no-fly zones) or certain additional restrictions, which must also be adhered to. This usually concerns airfields, military installations, prisons, government buildings and in Germany probably also residential areas (flight only with the consent of the property owner should remain, for example), see section \u201cNo Fly Zones\u201d in the article on the \u201cold\u201d drone regulation).\n* In Germany, these zones are being discussed in a current draft law and should find their way into the German Air Traffic Regulations (LuftVO) in the course of 2021. Until then, the points of the old drone ordinance will still apply, unless they deviate from the points of the EU drone ordinance mentioned in this article. In that case, the laws of the new regulation already apply.\n* Further restrictions additionally result from the drone class (C0-C4). More on this below.\n\n### Subcategory A1\n\n* Flight over people possible (depending on the C classification of the drone).\n* Overflight of uninvolved third parties must be avoided\n* No overflight over crowds of people\n\n### Subcategory A2\n\n* Flight at a safe distance from uninvolved persons (at least 30m).\n* For drones that have a \u201cSlow\u201d mode, the distance can be reduced to 5m\n\n### Subcategory A3\n\n* Flight only at a great distance from people\n* no uninvolved third parties in the entire flight area\n* minimum distance to residential, industrial and commercial areas of at least 150m\n\n### Overview graphic\n\nThe following graphic provides a coherent overview of the requirements for the Open application scenario, its subcategories A1, A2 and A3, ando the drone risk classes C0-C4 presented further below.\n\n## Use Case Scenario: Specific\n\nIf the planned drone flight does not meet one or more of the criteria listed in the Open category, it automatically slips into the Specific category. In this case, a separate SORA-GER risk assessment is required for the operation. This must be submitted to the authority in order to obtain an exemption for the planned flight.\n\nAlternatively, so-called standard scenarios can be used, which make a corresponding SORA-GER assessment superfluous and should simplify the approval process. Two standard scenarios are known to us so far:\n\n* STS-01 \u2013 VLOS (Visual Line of Sight) over a controlled area on the ground in a populated area.\n* STS-02 \u2013 BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line of Sight) over a controlled area on the ground in a sparsely populated area with airspace observer\n\nAuthorities are free to create further standard scenarios themselves. As soon as we receive more information, we will update this section.\n\nWith a LUC certificate (light UAS operator certificate), the application for authorization can be reduced to a one-time application. However, the cost and effort of a LUC certificate is not yet foreseeable. It is equivalent to a comprehensive certification of the drone pilot or the operation itself and will therefore be neither cheap nor quick to obtain.\n\n## Use Case Scenario: Certified (Certified)\n\n* Extensive approval procedures\n* Use cases: Overflight of crowds, transport of people or loads, transport of dangerous goods.\n* Not relevant for hobby pilots as well as for commercial drone pilots from the field of aerial photography\n\n## Drone classes C0-C4 of the EU Drone Regulation 2024\n\nIn the future, drones will be divided into five different risk classes marked C0 to C4. The class of a drone will be decisive for the category in which it can be flown and the requirements that are placed on the drone pilot.\n\nThe classification into a class is carried out by the manufacturer of the drone itself on the basis of established guidelines. The label will then be available to view before a drone is purchased.\n\nCurrently, there are only a handful of drones with appropriate C designations. Therefore, most current drones that will have to do without a C-label will fall into a special category and be listed as so-called inventory drones (more on this below, \u201cTransition phase for existing drones\u201d).\n\nIn this way, drones already on the market should be able to be used without any problems even with the new EU drone regulation. The following paragraphs provide an overview of the respective classes C0-C4. More details can be found in our separate article on the EU drone classes.\n\n### Drone class C0\n\nThe following drones included:\n\n* Weight of the drone is less than 250 grams (also for homebuilt drones).\n* Self-built drone over 250 grams falls under class C3 or C4\n\nSpecifications for the manufacturer/drone\n\n* The drone must not fly faster than 19 m/s (68 km/h)\n* Maximum flight altitude must be adjustable\n\nRegulations for this class\n\n* Drone pilot must read instruction manual\n* Drone pilot must register if there is a camera on the drone (in this case, it is also necessary to attach the license plate with the registration number of the drone pilot)\n* no EU drone license/EU proof of competence is necessary\n* It is allowed to fly in all subcategories of the Open application scenario, i.e. also over people (no crowds)\n\n### Drone class C1\n\nThe following drones included\n\n* Weight of the drone is less than 900 grams or the kinetic energy is less than 80 joules\n\nSpecifications for the manufacturer/drone\n\n* The drone must not fly faster than 19 m/s (68 km/h)\n* Maximum flight altitude must be adjustable\n* Return-to-home function must be available\n* Electronic identification (eID) is required\n* GEO awareness system (automatic flight restriction monitoring) is required\n\nRegulations for this class\n\n* Drone pilot must read instruction manual\n* Drone pilot must have EU certificate of competence (online training and online test), also known as \u201csmall EU drone license\u201d\n* Drone pilot must register and affix a drone license plate/badge with registration number to the drone\n* Flights from subcategory A1 in the Open application scenario possible (but no flight over people)\n\n### Drone class C2\n\nThe following drones included\n\n* Weight of the drone is less than 4 kilograms\n\nSpecifications for the manufacturer/drone\n\n* Maximum flight altitude must be adjustable\n* Return-to-home function must be available\n* Low-speed mode must be available\n* Electronic identification (eID) is required\n* GEO awareness system (automatic flight restriction monitoring) is required\n\nRegulations for this class\n\n* Drone pilot must read instruction manual\n* Drone pilot must have EU certificate of competence (online training and online test), also known as \u201csmall EU drone license\u201d\n* Drone pilot must register and affix a drone license plate/badge with registration number to the drone\n* For flights in subcategory A2 of the Open application scenario, the drone pilot must pass a theoretical test at a recognized testing center (EU remote pilot certificate or also known as \u201clarge drone driver\u2019s license\u201d)\n* A minimum distance of 30 meters from people must be maintained (subcategory A2)\n* However, when low-speed mode is activated (max. 3 m/s), the 1:1 rule applies in terms of altitude and distance to people. This means that at a flight altitude of 10m, you may fly up to 10m away from people. However, the distance must never be less than 5m.\n* Flights also possible in subcategory A3 of the application scenario Open\n\n### Drone class C3 and C4\n\nThe following drones included\n\n* Weight of the drone is less than 25 kilograms or drone is a homemade with more than 250 grams\n\nSpecifications for the manufacturer/drone\n\n* Maximum flight altitude must be adjustable\n* Return-to-home function must be available\n* Electronic identification (eID) is required\n* GEO awareness system (automatic flight restriction monitoring) is required\n* No autonomous flight allowed (class C4)\n\nRegulations for this class\n\n* Drone pilot must read instruction manual\n* Drone pilot must have EU certificate of competence (online training and online test), also known as \u201csmall EU drone license\u201d\n* Drone pilot must register and affix a drone license plate/badge with registration number to the drone\n* Flight only possible in subcategory A3 of the Open application scenario. So it is only allowed to fly outside of cities and only where no uninvolved persons can be endangered.\n\nSource: easa.europa.eu \u2013 [(EU) 2019/945](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019R0945)\n\n### Transition phase for existing drones\n\nSince there are only a few drones with the new C classification so far (as of July 2023), a transitional arrangement exists for most drones on the market (drones manufactured before Jan. 1, 2024, that do not have a C label).\n\nThe drones are allocated depending on their weight and corresponding restrictions are imposed. These can be found in summary in the list below. These drones can be flown without a C-label until Dec. 31, 2023 (validity of the transitional arrangement) depending on their weight in all subcategories of Open (A1 \u2013 A3, see list below).\n\nIt is officially called limited Open category by EASA.\n\n**Existing drones without C-classification (until 31.12.2023)**\n\n* Here, too, insurance is mandatory for all drones\n* Drone pilot must read operating instructions\n\n**Drones under 500g**\n\n* Flight possible in all subcategories (A1, A2, A3) of the Open application scenario\n* No EU drone license required (neither EU certificate of competence nor EU remote pilot certificate).\n* From 01.01.2024: EU certificate of competence required for operation of drones over 250g and under 500g in subcategory A1.\n\n**Drones from 500g and under 2kg**\n\n* Flight in subcategory A2 and A3 of the application scenario Open possible.\n* EU proficiency certificate (small EU drone license) for A3 and \u2026\n* EU remote pilot certificate (large EU drone license) required for operation in subcategory A2. Here, however, with increased distance to people (50m instead of 30m as for drones with C classification).\n* Note: Thanks to transitional regulation until 31.12.2023 also 30m for existing drones.\n\n**Drones from 2kg and under 25kg**\n\n* Flight in subcategory A3 of the application scenario Open possible\n* EU certificate of competence (small EU drone license) required for flights in subcategory A3\n\nFrom 01.01.2024, drones without C classification can be flown in A1 if the weight is below 250g (no EU drone license required) and in A3 (EU proof of competence required) if the weight is below 25kg.\n\nFlights in the A2 subcategory would therefore no longer be possible with existing drones weighing more than 250g. ([EASA FAQ](https://www.easa.europa.eu/faq/116508))\n\n## Insurance obligation\n\nRegardless of any new regulations and whether flying is private or commercial, drone insurance is always mandatory in Germany. This is already the case with the existing drone regulation.\n\nWe have summarized all information on drone liability insurance in the linked article. Our recommendation here is the favorable insurance coverage from [helden.de (ab 39\u20ac/Jahr)](https://helden.de/drohnenhaftpflicht/?src=dhpt&presetVoucher=DHPT4&utm_source=ner&utm_medium=li&utm_campaign=de.po.ro.sa)\\*.\n\n## Drone pilot registration\n\nThe online registration application for drone owners is available online. We have compiled important information on this in a corresponding news item.\n\nWe have summarized all information on registration and marking according to the current EU Drone Regulation in the following article: [**Registrierung und Kennzeichnung \u2013 eID \u2013 EU-Drohnenverordnung**](https://www.skyzr.com/registrierung-und-kennzeichnung-eid-eu-drohnenverordnung/)\n\n## EU Drone Operator Licenses of the EU Drone Regulation 2024\n\nAs mentioned several times above, the new EU Drone Regulation also introduces two new \u201cdrone operator licenses\u201d.\n\n* EU certificate of competence (\u201csmall EU drone pilot\u2019s license\u201d)\n* EU Remote Pilot Certificate (\u201clarge EU drone pilot\u2019s license\u201d)\n\nBoth \u201cdriving licenses\u201d will become mandatory as of 01.01.2021 in the respective required subcategory and C-classification (see notes above).\n\n### EU proof of competence\n\n* Online training\n* Online test\n* may be repeated as often as desired\n* probably free of charge and can be done online directly at the LBA\n* Validity: 5 years\n\n### EU Remote Pilot Certificate\n\n* EU proof of competence is a prerequisite\n* Practical self-training required (own written confirmation sufficient)\n* Theory test at a certified testing center required, usually in combination with a training course\n* Validity: 5 years\n* Fee-based, as carried out by external and certified providers\n\nIt is very likely that the official examining bodies that have been offering the proficiency test up to now will gradually switch over to the EU Remote Pilot Certificate as well.\n\nWe have summarized everything else that is important about EU drone licenses for you in our article EU Drone License \u2013 All Information.\n\n### What happens to an old issued certificate of knowledge?\n\nSo far, it is planned to keep the current drone knowledge certificates valid until the end of 2021. After that, they can be converted into the small EU drone license (i.e. EU certificate of competence).\n\nMore information will follow in a separate article.\n\n## Sources on the EU Drone Regulation\n\nThe official source for the EU Drone Regulation is EASA (European Union Aviation Safety Agency). Here you can find all official documents, draft laws and further information. The entire site is in English. Some documents are available in different languages. Particularly relevant here are the regulations [(EU) 2019/945](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32019R0945&from=EN) as well as [(EU) 2019/947](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32019R0947).\n\nThe Luftfahrt Bundesamt (LBA) [offers a short FAQ on the new EU drone regulation (german)](https://www.lba.de/DE/Drohnen/Allgemeine_Informationen/Allgemeine_Informationen_node.html), which we also used as a source for our article.\n\n## EU Drone Regulation 2024 FAQ\n\n**Since when is the current EU Drone Regulation 2024 in force?**\n\nThe current EU Drone Regulation 2024 has already been in force since 01.01.2021. Our detailed article provides all information on the current EU regulations.\n\n**Do I need drone insurance according to the EU Drone Regulation 2024?**\n\nYes, with the current EU Drone Regulation 2024, drone liability insurance is always mandatory. You are not allowed to fly without it.\n\n**Do I have to register as a drone pilot?**\n\nUnder the current EU Drone Regulation 2024, it may be mandatory to officially register as a drone pilot with the LBA. This depends on the risk class (C0-C4) of the drone used. We have summarized all the information in this article on the EU Drone Regulation.\n\n**What changes will the new EU Drone Regulation 2024 bring?**\n\nWith the current EU Drone Regulation, there have been numerous changes in the operation of drones. You can read all about the application scenarios and the new drone risk classes in our article on the EU Drone Regulation 2024.\n\n**Can I continue to use my existing certificate of knowledge?**\n\nThe German certificate of proficiency was valid until the end of 2021. It could be rewritten into the new EU certificate of competence (small EU drone license). More info can be found in the article.\n\n**What is the EU drone license?**\n\nWith the EU Drone Regulation 2024, there are two drone licenses: the small (EU Certificate of Competence) and the large (EU Remote Pilot Certificate). Depending on the drone risk class, one of the two may be necessary.

Our innovative marketplace platform is set to handle any clients today, tomorrow, and beyond.\n\nAndreas Nordansj\u00f6\n\nChief Marketing Officer\n\n# What you need to know about the 2024 EU Drone Regulations | Stay compliant with Globhe\n\nAre you prepared for the upcoming 2024 EU drone regulations? With significant changes just around the corner, understanding and adhering to these new standards is crucial for everyone in the drone industry. With Globhe however, we help our clients with the complaince, libaility and security, so they can focus on what they do best. We are the data collection partner you need when the industry is undergoing changes and opening up for a broader and more comprehensive use of drones in the future.\n\nWith this article we hope to shed some light on what is changing, and how Globhe have prepared to make sure we are compliant today, tomorrow and in a more distant future.\n\n\u200d\n\n## **New EU Drone Regulations**\n\nWhat is the new regulations put in place all about? The **European Union Aviation Safety Agency** (EASA) is putting in place comprehensive regulations, effective January 1, 2024 to ensure Europe is in the forefront of drone use and pave the way for future use-cases and extensive drone use across all fields of application. Let's explore what these particular changes are, and what they mean for drone operators.\u00a0Drones are classified into open, specific, and certified categories, each with unique operational limitations and compliance requirements. For instance, the open category caters to lower-risk activities, while the certified category addresses high-risk operations.\n\n\u200d\n\n#### **C Classifications**\u200d\n\nFrom January 1st, 2024, new drones placed on the market must have a C classification marking to be used in the open category. Existing drones can still be used under certain conditions. [***Read the information on\u00a0EASA\u00a0website here.***](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones) A quick summary is:\n\n1. Drones under 250 g can be flown in subcategory A1.\n2. Drones under 25 kg can be flown in subcategory A3.\n3. Drones weighing 250 g or more require the completion of the A1/A3 online theoretical examination.\n4. Flying in subcategory A2 is only possible with a C2-class drone\u200b\u200b.\n\n\u200d\n\n#### There are seven C classifications for drones:\n\n1. C0 and C1 are for the open subcategory A1.\n2. C2 is for the open subcategory A2.\n3. C2, C3, and C4 are for the open subcategory A3.\n4. C5 and C6 are for operations that require an operating permit and are subject to a fee\u200b\u200b.\n\n\u200d\n\n#### **Mandatory Registration and Identification**\u200d\n\nA critical aspect of these regulations is that Remote Identification for Drones will become mandatory starting Januari 1st, 2024, enhancing airspace safety and accountability across the EU.[***Read the information on\u00a0EASA\u00a0website here.***](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/general-publications/remote-identification-will-become-mandatory-drones-across)\n\n\u200d\n\n#### **Operational Authorization and Stringent Standards**\u200d\n\nOperations under the specific category require authorization from National Aviation Authorities, including operations beyond visual line of sight and those involving heavier drones.\n\nRead and understand all regulations at the official [***EASA Civil Drones Page***](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones)***.***\n\n\u200d\n\n### **Globhe: Paving the Way for Compliance and Efficiency**\n\n**\u200d**Navigating these regulations might seem challenging, but Globhe simplifies the process.

It defines the conditions the operator must observe when conduct all flights in the operation:\n\n#### Where to apply?\n\nThe applicant needs to apply to the [National Aviation Authority (NAA)](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones/naa) in the state where he/she is registered as an operator.\n\n#### What is to be provided in the application for the operational authorisation?\n\nA duly filled [application form](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/downloads/137214/en), a copy of the Operations Manual (OM) (please check the [EASA Operations Manual example for UAS operations at SAIL II](/en/document-library/general-publications/easa-operations-manual-example-uas-operations-sail-ii)) and of the compliance evidence document whose content varies depending on the risk of operation. For example, for low risk operations, the documents may be very small and simple.\u00a0The OM ([example for SAIL II UAS operations](/en/document-library/general-publications/easa-operations-manual-example-uas-operations-sail-ii)) should contain all information that the staff of the operator should know in order to ensure the safety of the operation. It contains a detailed description of the intended operations, as well as an insight of the organisation\u2019s culture and the operating procedures.\n\n#### Operational authorisation with a [PDRA](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-rpas/specific-category-civil-drones/predefined-risk-assessment-pdra)\n\nIf the operation you intend to conduct is covered by one of the published [PDRAs](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-rpas/specific-category-civil-drones/predefined-risk-assessment-pdra) you need to submit to the NAA a copy of the:\n\n![Apply for authorisation](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Apply%20for%20authorisation.png)\n\n![Apply for authorisation](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Apply%20for%20authorisation.png)\n\nThe PDRA table helps you to develop the operator manual that should contain all information that a staff of the operator should know in order to ensure the safety of the operation. It contains a detailed description of the intended operations, as well as an insight of the organization\u2019s culture and the operating procedures.\n\n#### Operational authorisation without a PDRA\n\nIf the operation intended to be conducted is not covered by any PDRA you need to firstly carry out a specific risk assessment. [Regulation (EU) 2019/947](/en/document-library/regulations/commission-implementing-regulation-eu-2019947) proposes the [SORA (specific operational risk assessment)](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-rpas/specific-category-civil-drones/specific-operations-risk-assessment-sora) methodology to be used for this purpose. You can find the SORA As the AMC 1 to Article 11 of Regulation (EU) 2019/947.\n\nThis methodology helps to identify the risk level of the operation and also to identify the mitigations and operational safety objectives needed to make the operation safe. When the drone operator believes to have properly classified the operation he/she should contact the [National Aviation Authority (NAA)](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones/naa) to apply for an operational authorization and have the NAA to review the risk assessment.\n\n![Pic4](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Picture4_0.png)\n\n![Pic4](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Picture4_0.png)\n\nThen the drone operator should demonstrate compliance with all mitigations and safety objectives to be ready for completing the application.\n\n![pic5](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Picture5_0.png)\n\n![pic5](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Picture5_0.png)\n\n*The main requirements of this risk assessment can be found in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) 2019/947.*  \n  \nAt this moment the UAS operator needs to submit to the NAA a copy of:\n\n![Apply for authorisation](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Apply%20for%20authorisation_0.png)\n\n![Apply for authorisation](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Apply%20for%20authorisation_0.png)\n\n#### Authorising an operational application\n\n(Article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2019/947)  \nThe NAA will issue an operational authorisation, when it considers that the risks are adequately mitigated. Then it will provide the drone operator with the [operational authorisation](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/downloads/137214/en) as soon as possible, and the operation can then start. See below If you want to operate in a state different from the state of registration.\n\n#### Validity of an authorisation\n\nThe operational authorisation will be valid in all EASA member state for all flights conducted within the limitations and duration defined in the authorisation. However, the NAA may impose a limitation in time and/or number of flights.\u00a0  \nOperation in a state different from the state of registration (Article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2019/947) please see the [dedicated page](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-rpas/specific-category-civil-drones/operations-specific-category-state-different-one-registration).\n\n#### Drone authorisation process with an NAA\n\nAs a drone operator in the EASA Member States it is important to get an authorisation from the [National Aviation Authority (NAA)](/domains/civil-drones/naa) of the country in which your organisation is based.\n\nOperational authorisations are needed to start a drone operation in the specific category. An authorisation is not needed if the operation is covered by a Standard Scenario or you already have a Light UAS operator certificate - LUC with the appropriate privileges.\n\nThe authorization process involves submitting an application to the NAA and includes an assessment of the risk of the intended operations, the provision of the organisation\u2019s Operations Manual (OM) and the required evidence to show compliance with the applicable requirements. It is also necessary to demonstrate competence as a drone operator and evidence of training, certifications and experience will be required to demonstrate your ability to conduct operations safely and responsibly.\n\nThe National Aviation Authorities will evaluate the applications and grant authorizations. They review your application, and ensure your operations comply with the regulatory requirements. Effective communication and collaboration with the NAA is vital throughout the authorization process. Respond promptly to any requests for additional information, provide accurate details to ensure a smooth process.\u00a0 The timeline for authorization may vary depending on the complexity of your operations and the workload of the Authority. It is advisable to submit your application well in advance to allow sufficient time for processing.\n\nObtaining an authorization demonstrates your compliance with the applicable requirements and it allows you to conduct specific category operations. These requirements are proportionate to risk level of your operation.\n\nThe authorisation is issued once the operator has shown compliance with the applicable requirements of the European Drone Rules in Regulation (EU) 2019/947, which is applicable since 31 December 2020. More information can be found on the [operating a drone](/operating-drone) page. This harmonizes the rules for drone operations across the European Union, including Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein \u2013 [the EASA Member States](/domains/drones-air-mobility/topics/easa-member-states). Once you receive your authorisation, this means you can use it to operate your drone in all these countries.\n\nIn summary, contact the NAA in the EASA country where you are based. They will then guide your through the full process and inform you on what authorisations and permits you need for your type of activity.\n\nFor additional information please [contact the team](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/contact-us-aviation?select=Aviation&aviation=Drones).\n\n##### [**EASA Website create account**](/user/register)**Stay informed on** Operational authorisation**:**\n\n![EASA Website create account](/sites/default/files/inline-images/easa-website-follow-create-account.png)\n\n### Downloads\n\n#### [Form for Application for an operational authorisation for the \u2018specific\u2019 category](/en/downloads/138404/en \"form_for_application_for_an_operational_authorisation.pdf\")\n\n#### [Form for Operational authorisation for the \u2018specific\u2019 category](/en/downloads/138405/en \"form_for_operational_authorisation.pdf\")\n\n#### [EASA Operations Manual example for UAS operations at SAIL II](/en/downloads/138411/en \"easa_operations_manual_example_for_uas_operations_in_sail_ii_1.docx\")\n\n### Related Content\n\n### [Easy Access Rules for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (Regulations (EU) 2019/947 and 2019/945)](/en/document-library/easy-access-rules/easy-access-rules-unmanned-aircraft-systems-regulations-eu)\n\n### [Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/947](/en/document-library/regulations/commission-implementing-regulation-eu-2019947)\n\n## ONLINE SERVICES\n\n## READ MORE\n\n## WEBSITE\n\n## CONNECT WITH US\n\n## CAN WE HELP YOU?\n\n![EU](/themes/custom/easa_foundation/images/eu_flag_small.png)",

To assess these risk levels, [EASA](https://www.easa.europa.eu) has created several flight categories **(Open, Specific)** which require the use of standardized drones that have received a class indication **(C0-C6)**.\n\n#### [Drone Open & Specific Summary for 2024](#1)\n\n[E](#2)\n\n#### [What is the open category?](#2)\n\n[E](#3)\n\n#### [What is the Specific category?](#3)\n\n[E](#4)\n\n#### [What are standard scenarios (STS)?](#4)\n\n[E](#5)\n\n#### [How to convert your drone into a C5 class ?](#5)\n\n[E](#6)\n\n#### [How do I fly outside STS scenarios in a specific category?](#6)\n\n[E](#7)\n\n#### [What is a PDRA (Pre-Defined Risk Assessment)?](#7)\n\n[E](#8)\n\n#### [What is a SORA (Specific Operations Risk Assessment)?](#8)\n\n[E](#9)\n\n#### [What is IGRC (Intrisinc Ground Risk Class) ?](#9)\n\n[E](#10)\n\n#### [What is Final GRC (Final Ground Risk Class) ?](#10)\n\n[E](#11)\n\n#### [What are MOC (Mean Of Compliance) ?](#11)\n\n[E](#12)\n\n#### [How to reduce Final GRC with MOC2512 (M2)?](#12)\n\n[E](#13)\n\n#### [How to complete part 8 with MOC2511 ?](#13)\n\n[E](#14)\n\n#### [What is a LUC (Light UAS Operator Certificate)?](#14)\n\n## Drone Open & Specific Summary for 2024\n\n**You\u2019re not sure you can fly your drone? You don\u2019t know which regulatory category it falls into?** Understanding the different flight categories and classifications is essential for professional drone pilots.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019re going to analyse the Open and Specific categories for you, clarifying their operational parameters and all the restrictions associated with them. Nevertheless, it\u2019s important to remember that airspace management is the responsibility of each European Member State, as is the establishment of airspace zones and the requirements for flying in them.\n\n## What is the open category?\n\nThe Open Category encompasses drone operations with minimal risk to individuals, property, and other aircraft. Primarily designed for recreational drone pilots, it comprises three subcategories\u2014**A1**, **A2**, and **A3**\u2014each adapted to various drone types and operational scenarios. Common to all subcategories are strict regulations, including:\n\n* **Prohibitions on flying over groups of uninvolved individuals**\n* **A maximum flight altitude of 120 meters above ground**\n* **The requirement for visual line of sight.**\n\n### SUBCATEGORY **A1**\n\nThe Open Category\u2019s A1 subcategory permits flying over uninvolved people, exclusively designated for drones equipped with identification tags C0 or C1. These drones posses a low-risk profile, although stringent precautions are still essential to mitigate potential incidents. A1-eligible drones must weigh a maximum of 900 grams and adhere to a maximum speed of 19m/s or 68 km/h.\n\n**C0 drones**, with a maximum weight of 250g, are allowed in both A1 and A3 categories, permitting flights over uninvolved individuals and within urban areas.\n\n**C1 drones**, with a maximum weight of 900g, are only permitted in A1 and A3 operations within urban areas, with the caveat that intentional flights over uninvolved individuals are strictly prohibited. Operations within the A1 category can fly close to or even above people with very light drones but are strictly prohibited from flying over groups of people.\n\n**C0 & C1 certified drones list** (not exhaustive)**:**\n\n* DJI Mini 2 SE / 3 / 3 Pro / 4 Pro **(C0)**\n* DJI Mavic 3 Classic **(C1)**\n* DJI Mavic 3 v2.0 **(C1)**\n* DJI Mavic 3 Cine v2.0 **(C1)**\n* DJI Air 3 **(C1)**\n\n## SUBCATEGORY **A2**\n\nSubcategory A2 within the Open Category imposes stricter requirements compared to A1. It permits flights with drones weighing up to 4 kilograms and includes prohibitions over sensitive sites, along with the necessity to maintain minimum safety distances from people and residential areas. Drone pilots operating within this category are mandated to fly within 30 meters of people or 5 meters if the low-speed mode is activated.\n\nIn addition to these regulations, A2 operations are exclusively designated for drones equipped with a label **C2**. Flying close to third parties is allowed in A2, with required horizontal distances set at 30 meters or flight altitude, or 5 meters when in low-speed mode.\n\n**C2 drones**, with a maximum weight of 4kg, are permitted in both A2 and A3 categories, enabling flights close to uninvolved people and within urban areas.\n\n**C2\u00a0certified drones list** (not exhaustive)**:**\n\n* DJI Mavic 3 Enterprise\n* DJI Mavic 3 Multispectral\n* DJI Mavic 3 Thermal\n* DJI Matrice M30 / Matrice M30T\n* AgEagle Sensefly eBee\n\n### SUBCATEGORY **A3**\n\nDesigned for higher-risk operations, Subcategory A3 permits drone flights with a take-off mass of up to 25 kilograms. Flying near people and vehicles is strictly prohibited, with a minimum safety distance of 150 meters required from unconcerned people.\n\nIn addition to these regulations, A3 operations are designated exclusively for drones equipped with C class labels C2, C3 and C4.\n\n**C3 & C4** drones are allowed only in A3 category flights, with a maximum weight of 25kg, and must maintain a minimum distance of 150 meters from urban areas and uninvolved individuals, including residential, commercial, industrial, and recreational areas.\n\n**C3\u00a0certified drones list** (not exhaustive)**:**\n\n* DJI Inspire 3\n* DJI M350 RTK\n* Quantum Trinity F90+\n* WingtraOne\n* Delair UX11 / UX11 Longue\n\n## What is the SPECIFIC category?\n\nThe EASA has established the Specific Category to regulate drone operations with higher levels of risk or complexity compared to those in the Open category. To operate within this category, there are four ways to obtain approval:\n\n**1.** Submission of a declaration according to **European Standard Scenarios (STS-01 / STS-02)**\n\n**2.** Obtaining a permit for a specific type of flight by submitting a **Pre-Defined Risk Assessment (PDRA)**\n\n**3.** Obtaining authorization for a specific type of flight by submitting a **Specific Operations Risk Assessment (SORA)**\n\n**4.** Obtaining a **Light UAS Operator Certificate (LUC)**\n\n[EASA - Operational Authorisation](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-rpas/specific-category-civil-drones/operational-authorisation)\n\n## What are standard scenarios (STS)?\n\nA standard scenario represents a pre-established operation, providing pilots different possibilities for their flights. Operators are not obligated to obtain operational authorization for STS operations. Therefore, it is essential to first determine if the operation can be accommodated under an STS.\n\nThere are two types of scenarios: **STS-01** and **STS-02**. The choice of scenario depends on the environment and type of missions in which you will operate your drone: urban areas, visual line of sight flights, beyond visual line of sight flights, controlled zones, etc.\n\nCommon features of flights under STS regulations include:\n\n* **Daytime flights are permitted, while night flights are strictly prohibited.**\n* **Drones with a wingspan less than 3 meters have the possibility to fly above controlled areas on the ground, whether in Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) or Visual Line of Sight (VLOS).**\n* **For drones with a wingspan less than 1 meter, flying over assemblies of people in VLOS is allowed, and BVLOS flights are possible above sparsely populated areas.**\n* **All flights are limited to a maximum height of 120 meters.**\n\n#### **STS-01** SCENARIO\n\nDesigned for operations with a low to medium level of risk, STS01 mandates the utilization of drones classified as **C5** class. These drones must adhere to a maximum speed of 5 m/s and maintain Visual Line of Sight (VLOS) during flight. Essentially, drones operating under STS01 regulations must stay within 120 meters from the ground, adjusted for terrain, and should not carry risky materials.\n\nAdditionally, the flight zone must be controlled on the ground if in a populated area. When flying near tall artificial obstacles, the maximum height can increase by up to 15 meters with permission.\n\nTo ensure compliance with STS01 regulations, drones must have the C5 class. Some C2/C3 drones (DJI Mavic 3, Inspire 3, Matrice 350) **may need to be upgraded using certified accessory/conversion kits that include a Flight Termination System (FTS) and a Parachute Recovery System (PRS).**\n\n### how to convert your drone into a C5 class ?\n\nIf your drone is a C2 model, you have the option to upgrade it to a C5 classification using a conversion kit. On the other hand, if it\u2019s a C3 model, you can achieve the C5 status with the use of an accessory kit.\n\nUsing Dronavia\u2019s conversion kit:\n\n* DJI Mavic 3 Enterprise **(C2)** = [Kronos AD Mavic 3E](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-dji-mavic-3/) **(C5)**\n* DJI Mavic 3 Thermal **(C2)** = Kronos AD Mavic 3T (C5)\n* DJI Mavic 3 Multispectral **(C2)** = Kronos AD Mavic 3M **(C5)**\n* DJI Mavic 3 Pro/Cine **(C2)** = Kronos Mavic 3 Pro Cine **(C5)**\n\nWith Dronavia\u2019s accessory kit:\n\n* DJI M350 RTK **(C3)** [is transformed into Matrice 350 RTK](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-dji-matrice-350/) **(C5)**\n* DJI Inspire 3 **(C3)** [is transformed into Inspire 3](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-dji-inspire-3/) **(C5)**\n\n[See the official list of C5 drones](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-rpas/open-category-civil-drones)\n\n#### **STS-02** scenario\n\nReserved for high-risk operations or those conducted in sensitive airspace, STS02 mandates the usage of a **C6** aircraft and comprehensive risk assessments, along with close coordination with air traffic control authorities. Similar to the STS-01 scenario, drones must stay within 120 meters from the ground, adjusting for terrain variations. However, BVLOS flights are only possible in ground-controlled areas and outside populated areas.\n\nFurthermore, drones operating under STS02 regulations must be C6 class and must not carry dangerous goods. A buffer zone, calculated based on the drone\u2019s characteristics and the Flight Termination System (FTS), must be maintained. The maximum flight distance is limited to 1 kilometer, and the drone must remain visible within 5 kilometers.\n\nIn cases where visibility is limited, or there is an absence of an aerial observer, a pre-programmed trajectory must be followed. However, if an aerial observer is present, the maximum flight distance extends to 2 kilometers.\n\n## How do I fly outside STS scenarios in a specific category?\n\nDepending on the risk of the operation to be carried out, the specific category does not offer pre-established requirements adapted to all operations. Each UAS operator must develop its own operational scenarios. This is a fundamental difference from the open category.\n\nThere are several ways of developing your own scenarios **(PDRA / SORA / LUC)** in order to fly outside the STS scenarios, but the methodology used is always that of the SORA. Here we present the SORA methodology and how it applies to these 3 methods.\n\n## what is a PDRA (**Pre-Defined Risk Assessment**)?\n\nIn the first instance, if the STS scenarios are not suitable for your mission, you will not have to resort immediately to a manual application. The intermediate stage is called Pre-Defined Risk Assessment (PDRA).\n\nIt is based on a large number of predefined missions which involve a higher risk than STS missions and which are frequently encountered in everyday life. In summary, PDRAs are pre-configured risk assessments based largely on the SORA methodology.\n\nThese PDRAs, are approved by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) as acceptable means of complying with Regulation 2019/947. We list some of them here:\n\n**PDRA-S: STS for uncertified drones**\n\nIf you want to fly a drone without a CE C5 or C6 class in an STS scenario, you can use a PDRA-S called **PDRA-S01 / PDRA-S02**.\n\n**PDRA-G: model for frequent missions**\n\nPDRA-Gs are structured in the same way as STSs, and differ only in the higher risks associated with the mission. The models that can be used are called **PDRA-G01 / PRDA-G02 / PDRA-G03.**\n\nEASA is already anticipating the future and is now working on the publication of new PDRAs to create new scenarios and facilitate access to them for professional telepilot :\n\n**PDRA-06:** Test operations for drones up to 8 metres, in areas where at least 50% of manned aviation can be detected.\n\n**PDRA-07:** Operations in the airport area to carry out inspections.\n\n**PDRA-08:** Drone swarm operations.\n\n## what is a SORA 2.5 (**Specific Operations Risk Assessment**)?\n\nIf your flight missions still do not correspond to any appropriate STS or PDRA, the SORA (Specific Operations Risk Assessment) solution is the best way to obtain authorisation. The SORA process was developed by an international forum made up of different safety and risk experts. The name of this organization is **JARUS (Joint Authorities for Rulemaking on Unmanned Systems).**\n\nThe SORA 2.5 method produces a value called **SAIL (Specific Assurance Integrity Level)**, which is the result of combining **the ground risk (GRC)**, **the air risk (ARC)** and the corresponding mitigation measures applied. Depending on the SAIL index obtained, the operation will be considered more or less risky:\n\n**Low risk (SAIL I and II)**  \n**Medium risk (SAIL III and IV)**  \n**High risk (SAIL V and VI)**\n\nOnce the risks have been defined, **the SORA 2.5 method indicates the minimum safety requirements that an operator must meet** in order to carry out the mission safely. The cost of developing a SORA application can range from \u20ac5,000 to \u20ac10,000.\n\n## what is the **operations manual (OM)**?\n\nAccording to Regulation (EU) 2019/947 an application for an operational authorisation in the specific category **must include an Operation Manual (OM),** together with the associated specific operations risk assessment (SORA), or a PDRA table if applicable, and the evidences of compliance.\n\nIf the operator\u2019s activity has already been declared (within his country) and he has an Operation Manual (OM) drawn up before 31/12/2020, then it can be considered as an Operation Manual (OM) within the meaning of European legislation. **All you need to do is complete this manual with the new specifics of the new regulation (EU 2019/947).**\n\nAs specialists in the immersive industry, we know that the drone is an essential tool. A well-written Operation Manual ensures safe and efficient flight operations. How to obtain an Operations Manual respecting the regulations in force as well as your operation? **Only one step: Fill out the form above (10 minutes)**\n\nAt the end of this step, we will send you the document and invite you to reread it to fully understand it. Don\u2019t let the complexity of drone regulations hold back your business. Take advantage of our professional MANEX writing service and ensure that your business is in compliance with current standards. We have a team of experts who master the complexities of drone regulations in France and Europe, offering a quality service that meets your specific needs.\n\nJordan Perrin\n\nInstructor and consultant, Immersive Ambition\n\n[create your operations manual (OM) easily](https://www.immersive-ambition.fr/en/manex)\n\n## What is IGRC (**INTRINSIC** **Ground Risk Class**) ?\n\n**INTRINSIC GROUND RISK CLASS**   \n**(Step #2 of SORA Methodology)**\n\nThe Ground Risk Class (GRC) is defined as the risk of a person being hit by a drone during a flight mission. To determine the intrinsic GRC , professional telepilots must take into account appendix F of the SORA 2.5 method, a table which takes into account the dimensions of the UAV, the maximum speed of the UAV and the population density present for the flight operation.\n\nOnce the initial intrinsic GRC has been determined, mitigation measures must be applied to reduce the risk and thus obtain the value of the final GRC.These mitigation measures are as follows:\n\n* There are effective engineered containment systems in place.\n* Systems that reduce the effects of the impact on people on the ground.\n* An effective emergency response plan is in place, available for use and has been validated.\n\n## What is FINAL GRC (**FINAL** **Ground Risk Class**) ?\n\n**FINAL GRC**  \n**(Step #3 of the SORA methodology)**\n\nAccording to this SORA methodology, the robustness of the mitigation measures is defined by the level of integrity offered by each of the mitigation measures and the level of assurance that the mitigation measures have achieved (for example, the method by which it is proven).\n\nThus, we find 3 types of robustness levels:\n\n**Low robustness**  \n**Medium robustness**  \n**High robustness**\n\nThus, depending on the robustness values of the mitigation measures applied, the GRC value can be reduced and the final GRC value obtained, always bearing in mind that it cannot be reduced below the minimum value in the resulting column of the \u201cUAS intrinsic ground risk class index\u201d table.\n\n## WHAT ARE MOC **(MEANS OF COMPLIANCE)** ?\n\nAn MoC (Means of Compliance) is a way for professional drone operators to demonstrate that they comply with the regulations and standards that apply to their activities, and to guarantee the quality and safety of the products they use. To obtain it, it is necessary to meet the current regulatory requirements published by EASA, the European Union\u2019s Aviation Safety Agency.\n\nIn addition to the quality and safety offered by a product that complies with the MOCs proposed by EASA, **professional drone operators can more easily obtain a SORA (Specific Operations Risk Assessment) or a PDRA (Pre-Defined Risk Assessment), flight authorisations issued for complex missions in a specific category.**\n\n\u201cAMCs are non-binding standards adopted by EASA to illustrate means to establish compliance with the Basic Regulation and its Implementing Rules.\n\nThe AMCs issued by EASA are not of a legislative nature. They cannot create additional obligations on the regulated persons, who may decide to show compliance with the applicable requirements using other means. However, as the legislator wanted such material to provide for legal certainty and to contribute to uniform implementation, it provided the AMC adopted by EASA with a presumption of compliance with the rules, so that it commits competent authorities to recognise regulated persons complying with EASA AMC as complying with the law.\u201d\n\n[Definition by EASA](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/acceptable-means-compliance-amcs-and-alternative-means-compliance-altmocs)\n\n### how to REDUCE FINAL GRC with **MOC2512 (M2)**?\n\nAs professional telepilots, it is important to be aware of the means of compliance for M2 mitigations of medium robustness, enabling you to reduce your final GRC score during the SORA application.\n\nMOC2512 (M2) designates the level of robustness required for the safety system in the event of a drone losing control and falling to the ground. To achieve this, the safety system must :\n\nReduce the effect of ground impact  \nOperate reliably in the event of loss of control  \nNot introduce any additional risk\n\nDronavia\u2019s Kronos Parachute Recovery Systems (PRS) for [DJI Inspire 3](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-dji-inspire-3/) and [Matrice 300/350](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-dji-matrice-350/) as well as for [DJI Mavic 3](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-dji-mavic-3/) comply with MOC25-12 (M2) published by the EASA and therefore reduce the final GRC score by one point.\n\n**To benefit from this score reduction, Dronavia is able to provide all the necessary proof (declaration of conformity, test reports, etc.) requested by the national authority and/or the EASA.**\n\n### how to complete part 8 \u00a0 with **MOC2511** ?\n\nStep 8 (Containment Requirements) of the SORA 2.5 discusses the risk of losing control of the aircraft and flying into adjacent areas where the risk to third parties (on the ground or in the air) may be greater. If the aircraft is not adequately designed, there may be probable reasons that could lead to an exit from the area of operation.\n\nThe operator must take into account a matrix which combines the SAIL and the final GRC of the adjacent area, explained in appendix E of the SORA 2.5. For any reinforced containment system, the operator must: \u201cdeclare compliance with the provisions of the document \u201cMeans of compliance with Light UAS.2511 \u2013 Reinforced containment\u201d, or provide proof of this compliance (technical description, test reports, etc.) when applying for a permit. \u201c\n\nThe Dronavia flight termination systems (FTS) of the Kronos range for [DJI Inspire 3](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronons-fts-inspire3/) and [Matrice 300/350](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/kronos-fts-matrice350/) as well as for [DJI Mavic 3](https://www.dronavia.com/produit/zephyr-fts-mavic3/) are compliant with MOC25-11 published by EASA and allow compliance with step 8 during the SORA application.\n\n**To benefit from this compliance, Dronavia is able to provide all the necessary evidence (declaration of conformity, test reports, ground risk buffer, etc.) requested by the national authority and/or the EASA.**\n\n## what is a LUC **(Light UAS Operator Certificate)**?\n\nThe latest solution is aimed at all users who have to submit activity reports for a well-defined type of operation on a very regular basis.\n\nLUC stands for Light UAS Operator Certificate and means that you are particularly familiar with the risks and safety measures to be applied for a specific type of drone operation.

Discover certification requirements and international operation guidelines.\n\nEuropean drone operations require strict compliance with European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) regulations that have fundamentally transformed how commercial and recreational drone pilots operate across EU member states. The complexity of these regulations creates significant challenges for operators who must understand classification systems, certification requirements, and operational limitations that vary based on drone weight, mission type, and geographic location.\n\nEASA drone regulations establish comprehensive frameworks that harmonize drone operations across 27 EU member states while ensuring aviation safety and public protection. Professional drone operators must navigate complex certification processes, operational limitations, and administrative requirements that affect everything from equipment selection to mission planning and pilot training.\n\nEuropean drone laws continue evolving as EASA adapts regulations to technological advances and operational experience while balancing safety requirements with industry growth and innovation needs. These regulatory changes require continuous monitoring and adaptation by professional operators who must maintain compliance while serving clients across multiple European jurisdictions.\n\n## Current Regulation Overview\n\n### Regulatory Framework Structure\n\nThe European Union drone regulation framework, established through Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/947 and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/945, creates unified standards across all EU member states. Professional operators must understand that these regulations supersede national drone laws and establish consistent requirements for certification, operations, and equipment across the European Union.\n\nThree operational categories define regulatory requirements based on risk assessment: Open, Specific, and Certified categories that determine certification requirements, operational limitations, and administrative obligations. Professional operators must correctly classify their operations to ensure appropriate compliance procedures and avoid regulatory violations.\n\nCE marking requirements mandate that drones sold in the European Union meet specific safety and performance standards established by EASA regulations. Professional operators must verify that their equipment carries appropriate CE markings and meets regulatory requirements for their intended operational category.\n\nTransitional provisions established in EASA regulations allow existing operators to continue operations under certain conditions while adapting to new requirements, but these provisions have specific timelines and limitations. Professional operators must understand transition deadlines and ensure compliance with new requirements before exemption periods expire.\n\n### Open Category Operations\n\nClass identification requirements mandate that drones used in Open category operations display appropriate class markings (C0-C6) that correspond to their technical specifications and operational limitations. Professional operators must verify that their equipment meets class requirements and displays appropriate markings for legal operations.\n\nSubcategory limitations within Open operations (A1, A2, A3) establish specific operational restrictions including maximum weights, altitude limits, and proximity to people that vary based on drone class and pilot qualifications. Professional operators must understand which subcategory applies to their operations and comply with corresponding limitations.\n\nRemote pilot competency requirements vary by Open subcategory, with A1/A3 operations requiring online training and competency demonstration while A2 operations require additional theoretical knowledge and practical skill demonstration. Professional pilots must obtain appropriate certifications before conducting operations in their intended subcategory.\n\nOperational limitations in Open category include maximum altitude restrictions, visual line of sight requirements, and prohibitions on operations over crowds or near airports without authorization. Professional operators must understand these limitations and plan missions accordingly to maintain regulatory compliance.\n\n### Specific Category Operations\n\nRisk assessment procedures require Specific category operators to conduct Specific Operations Risk Assessment (SORA) or demonstrate compliance with Standard Scenarios (STS) that establish operational limitations and mitigation measures. Professional operators must complete appropriate risk assessment processes and implement required safety measures.\n\nAuthorization requirements mandate that Specific category operations receive approval from national aviation authorities before commencement, with applications requiring detailed operational documentation and safety case development. Professional operators must allow adequate time for authorization processes and provide comprehensive documentation.\n\nStandard Scenarios provide pre-defined operational parameters for common Specific category operations including visual line of sight (STS-01) and beyond visual line of sight (STS-02) operations with specific limitations and requirements. Professional operators may use Standard Scenarios to streamline authorization processes for qualifying operations.\n\nOperational safety objectives establish specific safety targets that Specific category operations must achieve through appropriate mitigation measures and operational procedures. Professional operators must demonstrate how their operations meet required safety objectives through risk assessment and mitigation implementation.\n\n## Compliance Checklist and Procedures\n\n### Pre-Operation Compliance Requirements\n\nDrone registration obligations require operators conducting Specific category operations or Open category operations with drones heavier than 250 grams to register with national aviation authorities. Professional operators must complete registration processes and display registration numbers on their aircraft before conducting operations.\n\nInsurance requirements mandate appropriate liability coverage for commercial drone operations, with minimum coverage amounts specified by EASA regulations and national implementations. Professional operators must maintain adequate insurance coverage and provide documentation as required by operational authorizations.\n\nPilot certification verification ensures that remote pilots hold appropriate certificates for their intended operations, including theoretical knowledge demonstration and practical skill assessment. Professional operators must verify that all pilots meet certification requirements before assigning operational responsibilities.\n\nEquipment compliance verification confirms that drones and associated equipment meet EASA technical requirements and carry appropriate markings for intended operations. Professional operators must maintain documentation demonstrating equipment compliance and performance characteristics.\n\n### Operational Documentation Requirements\n\nOperations manual development requires Specific category operators to create comprehensive documentation describing operational procedures, safety measures, and emergency protocols. Professional operators must develop manuals appropriate for their operational complexity and authorization requirements.\n\nRisk mitigation documentation demonstrates how operators address identified risks through specific measures, procedures, and equipment capabilities. Professional operators must document risk mitigation strategies and demonstrate their effectiveness through operational procedures.\n\nMaintenance and inspection records require operators to maintain detailed documentation of aircraft maintenance, inspections, and modifications that affect airworthiness and compliance. Professional operators must establish maintenance programs and maintain accurate records.\n\nTraining records documentation requires operators to maintain evidence of pilot training, competency demonstration, and continuing education activities. Professional operators must document all training activities and ensure records remain current and accessible.\n\n### Ongoing Compliance Monitoring\n\nOperational limitations monitoring ensures that operations remain within authorized parameters including altitude restrictions, geographic limitations, and environmental conditions. Professional operators must establish procedures to monitor compliance and prevent unauthorized operations.\n\nChange management procedures require operators to assess how operational changes affect regulatory compliance and obtain appropriate approvals before implementation. Professional operators must establish change control processes that maintain regulatory compliance during operational evolution.\n\nIncident reporting obligations require operators to report safety incidents, regulatory violations, and equipment failures to appropriate authorities according to established procedures and timelines. Professional operators must understand reporting requirements and maintain incident response capabilities.\n\nRegulatory update monitoring ensures that operators remain aware of regulatory changes and adapt their operations accordingly to maintain compliance. Professional operators must establish procedures to monitor regulatory developments and implement necessary changes.\n\n## Certification Requirements\n\n### Remote Pilot Certification\n\nA1/A3 Open category certification requires completion of online theoretical training and competency demonstration through approved testing procedures. Professional pilots must complete training that covers air law, human performance, meteorology, flight performance, communications, and operational procedures relevant to drone operations.\n\nA2 Open category certification requires additional theoretical knowledge testing and practical skill demonstration that enables operations closer to people and in more complex environments. Professional A2 pilots must demonstrate enhanced competency in risk assessment, emergency procedures, and operational planning.\n\nSpecific category pilot certification requirements vary based on operational complexity and authorization conditions, potentially requiring enhanced theoretical knowledge, practical skills demonstration, and medical certification. Professional Specific category pilots must meet certification requirements specified in their operational authorizations.\n\nInstructor certification enables qualified pilots to provide training and competency assessment for other remote pilots seeking EASA certification. Professional instructor certification requires demonstrated expertise, teaching ability, and understanding of certification standards.\n\n### Aircraft Certification\n\nCE marking compliance ensures that drones meet European safety and performance standards established by EASA technical specifications. Professional operators must verify CE marking validity and understand equipment limitations established by certification standards.\n\nClass identification requirements mandate that CE-marked drones display appropriate class markings that correspond to their capabilities and operational limitations. Professional operators must understand class designations and ensure appropriate aircraft selection for intended operations.\n\nTechnical documentation requirements mandate that drone manufacturers provide comprehensive technical information including performance characteristics, operational limitations, and maintenance requirements. Professional operators must maintain access to technical documentation and understand equipment specifications.\n\nModification restrictions limit how CE-marked drones can be modified while maintaining certification compliance, with unauthorized modifications potentially invalidating CE marking and regulatory compliance. Professional operators must understand modification limitations and obtain appropriate approvals when necessary.\n\n### Organizational Certification\n\nSpecific category operator certification may require organizational approval for complex operations including beyond visual line of sight, operations over people, or transport of dangerous goods. Professional organizations must develop management systems and demonstrate competency for complex operations.\n\nTraining organization approval enables organizations to provide EASA-recognized training and certification services for remote pilots seeking regulatory compliance. Professional training organizations must meet EASA standards for curriculum, facilities, and instructor qualifications.\n\nMaintenance organization approval may be required for organizations providing maintenance services for complex drone systems or operations requiring enhanced airworthiness standards. Professional maintenance organizations must demonstrate competency and quality management systems.\n\nDesign and manufacturing certification applies to organizations developing drone systems for commercial sale in the European Union, requiring demonstration of compliance with EASA technical standards. Professional manufacturers must complete certification processes before marketing products in EU markets.\n\n## International Operation Guidelines\n\n### Cross-Border Operations\n\nEU member state operations benefit from harmonized EASA regulations that enable operations across national borders with consistent certification and authorization requirements. Professional operators can conduct operations throughout the EU using EASA certifications and authorizations obtained in any member state.\n\nThird country operations require understanding of local regulations and potential requirements for additional certifications or operational approvals when conducting operations outside the European Union. Professional operators must research destination country requirements and obtain necessary approvals before international operations.\n\nTemporary import procedures enable drone equipment certified in the EU to operate temporarily in some third countries under specific conditions and time limitations. Professional operators must understand import requirements and obtain appropriate documentation for temporary international operations.\n\nBilateral agreements between the EU and certain third countries may provide streamlined procedures for cross-border operations under specific conditions and operational limitations. Professional operators should investigate bilateral agreements that might facilitate international operations.\n\n### Equipment Movement and Customs\n\nCustoms documentation requirements for drone equipment may include detailed technical specifications, certification documentation, and operational justification when crossing international borders. Professional operators must prepare appropriate customs documentation and understand import/export requirements.\n\nCarnet procedures enable temporary import of drone equipment for specific operational purposes without permanent import procedures or duties. Professional operators conducting international operations should investigate carnet availability and application procedures.\n\nRestricted technology considerations apply to drone equipment that may be subject to export controls or import restrictions in certain countries due to dual-use technology concerns. Professional operators must understand technology transfer restrictions and obtain appropriate licenses when required.\n\nInsurance coordination ensures that liability coverage remains valid during international operations and meets requirements in destination countries. Professional operators must verify insurance coverage validity and obtain additional coverage when necessary for international operations.\n\n### Operational Coordination\n\nNotice to Airmen (NOTAM) procedures require coordination with air traffic control and aviation authorities when conducting drone operations that might affect manned aviation. Professional operators must understand NOTAM requirements and coordination procedures for their operational areas.\n\nAirspace authorization procedures vary between countries and may require advance coordination with military or civilian aviation authorities depending on operational location and complexity. Professional operators must research airspace requirements and obtain appropriate authorizations.\n\nEmergency response coordination ensures that international operations include appropriate emergency procedures and coordination with local authorities in case of incidents or equipment failures. Professional operators must establish emergency response procedures appropriate for their operational locations.\n\nCommunication requirements may include specific radio frequencies, procedures, or language requirements when conducting operations in international airspace or controlled areas. Professional operators must understand communication requirements and ensure appropriate equipment and training.\n\n## National Implementation Variations\n\n### Member State Specific Requirements\n\nNational competent authorities in each EU member state implement EASA regulations with potential additional requirements or procedures that affect operational compliance. Professional operators must understand national variations and additional requirements in their operational areas.\n\nRegistration procedures vary between member states in terms of application processes, fees, and documentation requirements despite harmonized EASA standards. Professional operators must complete registration procedures in their state of registration and understand renewal requirements.\n\nAuthorization processes for Specific category operations may include national variations in application procedures, processing times, and administrative requirements. Professional operators must understand national authorization procedures and allow appropriate time for approval processes.\n\nEnforcement procedures and penalties for regulatory violations may vary between member states despite harmonized EASA regulations, affecting operational risk assessment and compliance planning. Professional operators must understand enforcement approaches in their operational areas.\n\n### Administrative Procedures\n\nApplication submission procedures for certifications and authorizations may use different online systems or documentation formats in different member states. Professional operators must understand application procedures and requirements in their state of registration or operation.\n\nFee structures for registrations, certifications, and authorizations vary between member states and may include different payment methods or currency requirements. Professional operators must budget appropriately for regulatory fees and understand payment procedures.\n\nProcessing timelines for regulatory approvals may vary between member states based on administrative capacity and application complexity. Professional operators must plan operational timelines to accommodate approval processes and potential delays.\n\nAppeal procedures for regulatory decisions may differ between member states and could affect operators' ability to challenge adverse decisions or seek clarification of requirements. Professional operators should understand appeal procedures and their rights under national implementations.\n\nProfessional EASA compliance services like those provided by [Flyby Guys](https://www.flybyguys.com) combine regulatory expertise with operational experience to help clients navigate complex European drone regulations while maintaining compliance across multiple jurisdictions and operational categories.\n\nDrone operators working with experienced compliance providers often discover that systematic regulatory management programs provide operational and legal benefits that extend beyond simple rule compliance to support business development and international expansion strategies.\n\nUnderstanding how EASA regulations integrate with [drone data processing requirements](https://www.flybyguys.com/blog/drone-data-processing-capture-to-deliverable) helps professional operators develop comprehensive compliance strategies that address both regulatory obligations and operational data management requirements.\n\nReady to ensure EASA compliance for your European drone operations?

It defines the conditions the operator must observe when conduct all flights in the operation:\n\n#### Where to apply?\n\nThe applicant needs to apply to the [National Aviation Authority (NAA)](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones/naa) in the state where he/she is registered as an operator.\n\n#### What is to be provided in the application for the operational authorisation?\n\nA duly filled [application form](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/downloads/137214/en), a copy of the Operations Manual (OM) (please check the [EASA Operations Manual example for UAS operations at SAIL II](/en/document-library/general-publications/easa-operations-manual-example-uas-operations-sail-ii)) and of the compliance evidence document whose content varies depending on the risk of operation. For example, for low risk operations, the documents may be very small and simple.\u00a0The OM ([example for SAIL II UAS operations](/en/document-library/general-publications/easa-operations-manual-example-uas-operations-sail-ii)) should contain all information that the staff of the operator should know in order to ensure the safety of the operation. It contains a detailed description of the intended operations, as well as an insight of the organisation\u2019s culture and the operating procedures.\n\n#### Operational authorisation with a [PDRA](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-rpas/specific-category-civil-drones/predefined-risk-assessment-pdra)\n\nIf the operation you intend to conduct is covered by one of the published [PDRAs](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-rpas/specific-category-civil-drones/predefined-risk-assessment-pdra) you need to submit to the NAA a copy of the:\n\n![Apply for authorisation](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Apply%20for%20authorisation.png)\n\n![Apply for authorisation](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Apply%20for%20authorisation.png)\n\nThe PDRA table helps you to develop the operator manual that should contain all information that a staff of the operator should know in order to ensure the safety of the operation. It contains a detailed description of the intended operations, as well as an insight of the organization\u2019s culture and the operating procedures.\n\n#### Operational authorisation without a PDRA\n\nIf the operation intended to be conducted is not covered by any PDRA you need to firstly carry out a specific risk assessment. [Regulation (EU) 2019/947](/en/document-library/regulations/commission-implementing-regulation-eu-2019947) proposes the [SORA (specific operational risk assessment)](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-rpas/specific-category-civil-drones/specific-operations-risk-assessment-sora) methodology to be used for this purpose. You can find the SORA As the AMC 1 to Article 11 of Regulation (EU) 2019/947.\n\nThis methodology helps to identify the risk level of the operation and also to identify the mitigations and operational safety objectives needed to make the operation safe. When the drone operator believes to have properly classified the operation he/she should contact the [National Aviation Authority (NAA)](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones/naa) to apply for an operational authorization and have the NAA to review the risk assessment.\n\n![Pic4](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Picture4_0.png)\n\n![Pic4](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Picture4_0.png)\n\nThen the drone operator should demonstrate compliance with all mitigations and safety objectives to be ready for completing the application.\n\n![pic5](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Picture5_0.png)\n\n![pic5](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Picture5_0.png)\n\n*The main requirements of this risk assessment can be found in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) 2019/947.*  \n  \nAt this moment the UAS operator needs to submit to the NAA a copy of:\n\n![Apply for authorisation](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Apply%20for%20authorisation_0.png)\n\n![Apply for authorisation](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Apply%20for%20authorisation_0.png)\n\n#### Authorising an operational application\n\n(Article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2019/947)  \nThe NAA will issue an operational authorisation, when it considers that the risks are adequately mitigated. Then it will provide the drone operator with the [operational authorisation](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/downloads/137214/en) as soon as possible, and the operation can then start. See below If you want to operate in a state different from the state of registration.\n\n#### Validity of an authorisation\n\nThe operational authorisation will be valid in all EASA member state for all flights conducted within the limitations and duration defined in the authorisation. However, the NAA may impose a limitation in time and/or number of flights.\u00a0  \nOperation in a state different from the state of registration (Article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2019/947) please see the [dedicated page](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-rpas/specific-category-civil-drones/operations-specific-category-state-different-one-registration).\n\n#### Drone authorisation process with an NAA\n\nAs a drone operator in the EASA Member States it is important to get an authorisation from the [National Aviation Authority (NAA)](/domains/civil-drones/naa) of the country in which your organisation is based.\n\nOperational authorisations are needed to start a drone operation in the specific category. An authorisation is not needed if the operation is covered by a Standard Scenario or you already have a Light UAS operator certificate - LUC with the appropriate privileges.\n\nThe authorization process involves submitting an application to the NAA and includes an assessment of the risk of the intended operations, the provision of the organisation\u2019s Operations Manual (OM) and the required evidence to show compliance with the applicable requirements. It is also necessary to demonstrate competence as a drone operator and evidence of training, certifications and experience will be required to demonstrate your ability to conduct operations safely and responsibly.\n\nThe National Aviation Authorities will evaluate the applications and grant authorizations. They review your application, and ensure your operations comply with the regulatory requirements. Effective communication and collaboration with the NAA is vital throughout the authorization process. Respond promptly to any requests for additional information, provide accurate details to ensure a smooth process.\u00a0 The timeline for authorization may vary depending on the complexity of your operations and the workload of the Authority. It is advisable to submit your application well in advance to allow sufficient time for processing.\n\nObtaining an authorization demonstrates your compliance with the applicable requirements and it allows you to conduct specific category operations. These requirements are proportionate to risk level of your operation.\n\nThe authorisation is issued once the operator has shown compliance with the applicable requirements of the European Drone Rules in Regulation (EU) 2019/947, which is applicable since 31 December 2020. More information can be found on the [operating a drone](/operating-drone) page. This harmonizes the rules for drone operations across the European Union, including Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein \u2013 [the EASA Member States](/domains/drones-air-mobility/topics/easa-member-states). Once you receive your authorisation, this means you can use it to operate your drone in all these countries.\n\nIn summary, contact the NAA in the EASA country where you are based. They will then guide your through the full process and inform you on what authorisations and permits you need for your type of activity.\n\nFor additional information please [contact the team](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/contact-us-aviation?select=Aviation&aviation=Drones).\n\n##### [**EASA Website create account**](/user/register)**Stay informed on** Operational authorisation**:**\n\n![EASA Website create account](/sites/default/files/inline-images/easa-website-follow-create-account.png)\n\n### Downloads\n\n#### [Form for Application for an operational authorisation for the \u2018specific\u2019 category](/en/downloads/138404/en \"form_for_application_for_an_operational_authorisation.pdf\")\n\n#### [Form for Operational authorisation for the \u2018specific\u2019 category](/en/downloads/138405/en \"form_for_operational_authorisation.pdf\")\n\n#### [EASA Operations Manual example for UAS operations at SAIL II](/en/downloads/138411/en \"easa_operations_manual_example_for_uas_operations_in_sail_ii_1.docx\")\n\n### Related Content\n\n### [Easy Access Rules for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (Regulations (EU) 2019/947 and 2019/945)](/en/document-library/easy-access-rules/easy-access-rules-unmanned-aircraft-systems-regulations-eu)\n\n### [Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/947](/en/document-library/regulations/commission-implementing-regulation-eu-2019947)\n\n## ONLINE SERVICES\n\n## READ MORE\n\n## WEBSITE\n\n## CONNECT WITH US\n\n## CAN WE HELP YOU?\n\n![EU](/themes/custom/easa_foundation/images/eu_flag_small.png)",

The **European Union Aviation Safety Agency** (EASA) is putting in place comprehensive regulations, effective January 1, 2024 to ensure Europe is in the forefront of drone use and pave the way for future use-cases and extensive drone use across all fields of application. Let's explore what these particular changes are, and what they mean for drone operators.\u00a0Drones are classified into open, specific, and certified categories, each with unique operational limitations and compliance requirements. For instance, the open category caters to lower-risk activities, while the certified category addresses high-risk operations.\n\n\u200d\n\n#### **C Classifications**\u200d\n\nFrom January 1st, 2024, new drones placed on the market must have a C classification marking to be used in the open category. Existing drones can still be used under certain conditions. [***Read the information on\u00a0EASA\u00a0website here.***](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones) A quick summary is:\n\n1. Drones under 250 g can be flown in subcategory A1.\n2. Drones under 25 kg can be flown in subcategory A3.\n3. Drones weighing 250 g or more require the completion of the A1/A3 online theoretical examination.\n4. Flying in subcategory A2 is only possible with a C2-class drone\u200b\u200b.\n\n\u200d\n\n#### There are seven C classifications for drones:\n\n1. C0 and C1 are for the open subcategory A1.\n2. C2 is for the open subcategory A2.\n3. C2, C3, and C4 are for the open subcategory A3.\n4. C5 and C6 are for operations that require an operating permit and are subject to a fee\u200b\u200b.\n\n\u200d\n\n#### **Mandatory Registration and Identification**\u200d\n\nA critical aspect of these regulations is that Remote Identification for Drones will become mandatory starting Januari 1st, 2024, enhancing airspace safety and accountability across the EU.[***Read the information on\u00a0EASA\u00a0website here.***](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/general-publications/remote-identification-will-become-mandatory-drones-across)\n\n\u200d\n\n#### **Operational Authorization and Stringent Standards**\u200d\n\nOperations under the specific category require authorization from National Aviation Authorities, including operations beyond visual line of sight and those involving heavier drones.\n\nRead and understand all regulations at the official [***EASA Civil Drones Page***](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones)***.***\n\n\u200d\n\n### **Globhe: Paving the Way for Compliance and Efficiency**\n\n**\u200d**Navigating these regulations might seem challenging, but Globhe simplifies the process.

You can be both a drone operator and a remote pilot if you are also the person who actually flies the drone. However, you could be the remote pilot without being a drone operator, if, for example, you are a pilot working for a company which provides services with drones. In that case, the company is the drone operator and you are the remote pilot.\n\n![UAS Operator](/sites/default/files/inline-images/UAS%20Operator.png)\n\nIf you bought a drone to fly it in your leisure time, you are both the drone operator and remote pilot.\n\nIf you bought a drone to give away as a gift, the person who will receive the gift and then fly the drone will be the drone operator and the remote pilot.\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n#### Types of drone the Regulation refers to\n\n\u2018Unmanned Aircraft\u2019 means any aircraft operating or designed to operate autonomously or to be piloted remotely without a pilot on board;\n\n![Types drones](/sites/default/files/inline-images/types-drones.JPG)\n\n![Types drones](/sites/default/files/inline-images/types-drones.JPG)\n\nThis definition includes all types of aircraft without a pilot on board, including radio-controlled flying models (powered fixed wing, helicopters, gliders) whether they have an on-board camera or not.\n\nThe Regulations use the term UAS, unmanned aircraft system, to refer to a drone, its system and all the other equipment used to control and operate it, such as the command unit, the possible catapult to launch it and others.\n\nRPAS (Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems) is a subcategory of UAS, which includes both RPAS and fully autonomous UAS. Fully autonomous UAS fly completely by themselves without the need for any pilot intervention.\n\n*Regulatory reference: paragraph 30 of Article 3 of Regulation (EU) 1139/2018 / Article 2(1) of EU regulation 2019/947 and article 3(3) of EU regulation 2019/945*\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n#### When is a drone considered to be a toy?\n\nA drone is considered as a toy when it could be attractive to a child. More precisely, products designed or intended whether or not exclusively, for use in play by children under 14 years of age should be considered as a toy and comply with the Directive 2009/48/EC on the safety of toys. The compliance of a drone with that directive is declared in the corresponding EU declaration of conformity. In case of doubts, the fact that a product should be considered as a toy is assessed by market surveillance authorities based on a number of characteristics related to the attractiveness of the product for kids, accessibility, etc.\n\nHowever, manufacturers may clearly exclude their product from the application of the Directive on the safety of toys (when a confusion is possible) by indicating clearly a minimum age > 13 years on their product (packaging, manual etc.) (e.g; \u201cnot for use under 14 years\u201d).\n\n*Regulatory reference: Article 2 of Directive 2009/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2009 on the safety of toys.*\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n#### What is the difference between autonomous and automatic drone?\n\nAn **autonomous** drone is able to conduct a safe flight without the intervention of a pilot. It does so with the help of artificial intelligence, enabling it to cope with all kinds of unforeseen and unpredictable emergency situations.  \n\u00a0  \nThis is different from **automatic** operations, where the drone flies pre-determined routes defined by the drone operator before starting the flight. For this type of drone, it is essential for the remote pilot to take control of the drone to intervene in unforeseen events for which the drone has not been programmed.  \n\u00a0  \nWhile **automatic** drones are allowed in all **categories, autonomous** drones are not allowed in the \u2019open\u2019 category.\n\nAutonomous drones need a level of verification of compliance with the technical requirements that is not compatible with the system put in place for the \u2019open\u2019 category. Autonomous operations are, instead, allowed in the \u2019specific\u2019 category, where the Regulation includes a tool flexible enough to verify requirements with the appropriate level of robustness.\n\nAutonomous operations are also allowed in the \u2019certified\u2019 category.\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n#### Who is an \u2018uninvolved person\u2019?\n\n\u2018An uninvolved person is a person who is not participating in the UAS operation or who is not aware of the instructions and safety precautions given by the UAS (drone) operator\u2019.\n\n**A person is considered** involved **if he/she** decides to be a part of the operation, understands the risk and is able to check the position of the drone while it is flying.\n\nTherefore, in order to be considered \u2018involved\u2019 in the operation, a person needs to:\n\nWriting on a ticket that a drone will be used during an event is not considered sufficient, since the drone operator needs to receive individual explicit consent and make sure people understand the risk and the procedures to be taken in case of an emergency.\n\nDuring the operation, it is expected that involved persons will follow the trajectory of the drone and be ready to take action to protect themselves in case the drone behaves unexpectedly. If, during the UAS operation, people are busy working or watching something that is not compatible with monitoring the trajectory of the drone, than they cannot be considered to be involved.\n\nExamples of uninvolved people:\n\nAn uninvolved person is not only a person who is directly exposed to a drone, but could also be a person who is in a bus, car, etc., and who is indirectly exposed. For example, if a drone is flying over a car, its driver should be considered to be an \u2018uninvolved person\u2019. The reason is that a drone flying close to a car (even if it does not impact it) could possibly distract its driver and therefore cause a car accident.\n\n*Regulatory reference: GM1 Article 2(18) Definitions, ED Decision 2019/021/R.*\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n#### What is an \u2018assembly of people\u2019?\n\nAn assembly of people is a crowd of people. It is not defined by a specific number of people, but is related to the possibility for an individual to move around in order to avoid the consequences of a drone which is out of control. If a group of people are so densely packed that their possibility to freely escape or move away from the drone is limited, then it is considered to be an assembly of people.\n\nExamples of assemblies of people are the people in:\n\n*Regulatory reference: GM1 Article 2(3) Definitions, ED Decision 2019/021/R*\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n#### What is covered by the regulations?\n\nThese EU Regulations adopt a risk-based approach, and as such, do not distinguish between leisure or commercial activities. They take into account the weight and specifications of the drone and the operation it is intended to undertake.\n\nThe Regulations cater for drones sold on the market, meaning:\n\n*1. when operating in the \u2019open\u2019 category:*\n\n*2. when operating in the \u2019specific\u2019 category, all drones falling under this category including those\u00a0without a \u00a0class identification label.*\n\nEU Regulation 2019/947 caters for most types of operation and their levels of risk. It does so through three categories of operations: the \u2018open\u2019, \u2018specific\u2019 and \u2018certified\u2019 categories.\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n#### Is it possible for an EASA Member State (MS) to maintain its national drone regulation in parallel with the new European drone legislation?\n\nNo. The EU drone regulation is an act that became immediately applicable in all EU MSs since 31 December 2020 superseding national regulations and making them not applicable anymore. However the European drone regulations provide some flexibility for the MSs to develop acts to define certain aspects such as:\n\nThe EASA MSs cannot develop any further regulations on drones on a topic that is already regulated by the European Drone regulation.\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n#### Are the UK issued certificates for unmanned aircraft system, including training of remote pilot, accepted in EU after December 31, 2020?\n\nThis FAQ is placed in\u00a0[Brexit -\u00a0Aircraft Operations](https://www.easa.europa.eu/faq/123767)\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n### [Registration requirements](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/the-agency/faqs/registration-requirements)\n\n#### Do I need to register my drone?\n\nUnless they are certified, drones do not need to be registered,\u00a0but **you, as drone operator/owner, must register yourself**. You do so with the National Aviation Authority **of the [EU country you residence in](/domains/civil-drones/naa)**. (<https://www.easa.europa.eu/domains/civil-drones/naa>)\n\nYou register once, independently of how many drones you have operating in the \u2019open\u2019 or the \u2019specific\u2019 category.

Therefore, it is important for you to consult your National Aviation Authority to check where you can and cannot fly your drone.\n\n![Geo awareness](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Flexibility%20of%20Member%20States_0.png)\n\n**These geographical zones apply to all categories.**\n\nIn addition, you are not allowed to fly a drone close to or inside an area where there is an ongoing emergency response.\n\nSee the links to National Aviation Authorities at:\n\n<https://www.easa.europa.eu/domains/civil-drones/naa>\n\n*Regulatory reference: \u00a0Article 15 and UAS.OPEN.060 (4) of EU regulation 2019/947.*\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n#### Can I fly over people?\n\nGenerally when you operate in the \u2018open\u2019 category, you are not allowed to fly over uninvolved people, unless you have a privately built drone with a weight below 250 g or a drone purchased on the market with a \u00a0class identification label0 or 1 mark. In any case, try to minimise the time during which you fly over people.\n\nIf you have a drone with a CE class 2 mark, under subcategory A2, as a general rule, keep the UA at a lateral distance from any uninvolved person that is not less than the height at which the drone is flying (this is the \u20181:1 rule\u2019, i.e. if the UA is flying at a height of 40 m, the distance from any uninvolved person should be at least 40 m), and never fly closer than 30 metres horizontally from any uninvolved person. If your drone is equipped with a low-speed mode function and this is active, you can fly as close as 5 metres from uninvolved people.\u00a0\n\n![Can I fly over people?](/sites/default/files/inline-images/FlyOverPeople.png)\n\n![Can I fly over people?](/sites/default/files/inline-images/FlyOverPeople.png)\n\nDistance from uninvolved people in the case of flying with a class C2 drone\n\nIn all other cases (drones with \u00a0class identification label3, 4, 5 or 6 marks or privately built and heavier than 250 g), you need to ensure that no uninvolved people are present within the range of the operation.\n\n*Regulatory reference: article 4 (1) (c) and UAS.OPEN.040 of EU regulation 2019/947.*\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n#### How high can I fly my drone?\n\nYour maximum flight height is generally 120 m from the earth\u2019s surface. Please check whether the National Aviation Authority imposes a geographical zone with a lower limit in the area where you fly. If you need to fly over an obstacle taller than 120 m, you are allowed to fly up to 15 metres above the height of the obstacle, but only if there is an explicit request from the owner of the obstacle (e.g. a contract with the owner to perform an inspection). In such a case, you may fly within a horizontal distance of 50 metres from the obstacle.\n\nWhen you are operating in hilly environments, the height of the drone above the surface of the earth should be within the grey zone in the picture below: you need to keep the drone within 120 m of the closest point of the terrain. This means that there may be conditions such as on top of a hill where even if you keep your drone 120 m from the side of the hill, you are actually flying at a distance higher than 120 m above the bottom of the valley. So as long as you keep your drone within 120 m of the shoulder of the hill (as in the grey area in the picture below), your flight is legal.\n\n![How high can I fly my drone](/sites/default/files/inline-images/How%20high%20can%20I%20fly%20my%20drone.png)\n\n![How high can I fly my drone](/sites/default/files/inline-images/How%20high%20can%20I%20fly%20my%20drone.png)\n\n*Regulatory reference: UAS.OPEN.010 (2) (3) Annex Part A of EU Regulation 2019/947*\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n### [Geographical zones (where I can fly)](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/the-agency/faqs/geographical-zones-where-i-can-fly)\n\n#### How do I know if can fly in a location?\n\nAll states are required to publish maps identifying geographical zones where all drone flights are forbidden or where you need to have a flight authorisation before starting the operation. In most of state, apps for mobile phones are available to easily identify where you can fly. Please check the website of your NAA (<https://www.easa.europa.eu/domains/civil-drones/naa>).\n\nFlight authorisations are different from the operational authorisation required for the specific category. A flight authorisation is applicable to all operations in \u2018open\u2019 or \u2018specific\u2019 category and is issued by the authority/entity identified in the maps by the state. For example a state may want to restrict the flights over a natural park or a riskier area such as industrial area or over a prison etc. The state may then publish a geographical zone requiring that all drone operations conducted in these zones must have a flight authorisation issued by the authority managing the area (e.g the park authority or the owner of the industry etc..).\n\nOther types of geographical zones are those where one or more of the limitation of the open category are alleviated. For examples area where the state may authorise all drones to operate up to a height more than 120m or with drones heavier than 25kg or in BVLOS etc., without the need for an authorisation or a declaration. This may be very useful to fly model aircraft for example.\u00a0  \nMake sure you check the geographical zones before starting the operation and you always respect them.\n\n*Regulatory reference Article 15 of EU Regulation 2019/947*\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n### [Other requirements](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/the-agency/faqs/other-requirements)\n\n#### Is there a minimum age to fly a drone?\n\nThe general rule mandates that the minimum age for remote pilots of drones in the \u2018open\u2019 and \u2019specific\u2019 categories is 16 years old. However, there\u00a0are exceptions. There is no minimum age for remote-pilot requirements:\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n#### Do I need insurance?\n\nYou, as drone operator, are always required to have an insurance for your drone if you are using a drone with a weight above 20kg.

In such cases, they may have received operational authorisations from their National Aviation Authorities in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) 2019/947, which also covers the organisation of such events.\n\nIf, instead, you want to conduct a race that is not within a club or association and with no spectators (in this context meaning uninvolved persons, see the definition above) present, you will fall under the **\u2018open\u2019 category** and you can operate under subcategory A3.\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n#### Is flying with goggles (first person view) authorised in the 'open' category?\n\nThe Regulation allows you to fly without keeping direct eye contact with the drone, provided you have a person next to you, a UA observer, keeping direct visual contact with the drone, scanning the airspace to make sure that you do not endanger other parties (e.g. aircraft or buildings or persons). **The UA observer must be located alongside you so they can immediately communicate with you** in case they see an obstacle, and give you instructions, such as to immediately land the drone.\n\n*Regulatory reference: Article 4(d) of EU regulation 2019/947*.\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n#### Are spectators allowed in the 'open' category?\n\nWhen operating in the \u2018open\u2019 category, **flying over uninvolved people is not allowed**, so there must not be any spectators. See also the explanation on uninvolved persons under [\u2018understanding EU Regulations 2019/947 and 2019/945\u2018.](/the-agency/faqs/drones-uas#category-regulations-on-uas-drone-explained)\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n#### Is beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) operation possible for flying drones with goggles (first-person view (FPV)) operation?\n\n***NB*** **This answer applies only to non-racing FPV operation.**\n\nOne of the conditions to operate in the open category is for the remote pilot to keep the drone in **visual line of sight (VLOS)**at all times. There are only two exceptions where VLOS is not strictly applied:\n\nIt is important to note that the open category catalogues all lower-risk drone operations **without the need for prior authorisation**; this lighter provision is compensated by more restrictive conditions of operation.\n\nFPV googles by nature do not allow to have a wide field of view to see potential threats around the drone, so they do not enable VLOS.\u00a0 Hence, the requirement for an **unmanned-aircraft observer**for any FPV operation when operating in the open category. The **unmanned-aircraft observer**must look at the drone and be alongside the remote pilot so that the **unmanned-aircraft observer** can immediately inform the remote pilot in case of any threat around the drone.\n\nWith the above conditions, you are allowed to fly FPV in the open category. However, you need to be mindful of the risk to hit a person or other aircraft.\n\nIf you want to have a drone race in FPV, spectators are not allowed; please note that drones with a speed higher than 19 m/s are only allowed to operate in open subcategory A3 (far from people). Therefore, in case you want to have spectators, the FPV race should be conducted in the specific category (including standards scenarios).

For all other operations in the \u2019specific\u2019 category, an operational authorisation issued by the National Aviation Authority is needed.\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n#### I fall under the \u2018specific\u2019 category, so how do I obtain an authorisation?\n\nFirstly check whether your operation can be accommodated within a **standard scenario**. If it can, you do not need an authorisation, but you do need to submit a declaration to the National Aviation Authority. A standard scenario is an operation defined in the Appendix to the drone regulation (EU Regulation 2019/947). You need to use a drone marked with the appropriate class identification label (5 or 6). After submitting the declaration to the National Aviation Authority, you will receive the confirmation of receipt and completeness from the National Aviation Authority and operate following the limitations of the standard scenario.  \nOtherwise, there are other means to obtain an operational authorisation under the \u2018specific\u2019 category, depending on the level of risk the operation poses. The drone operator can apply for:\n\n**Light UAS operator certificate (LUC)**: this is a voluntary certification, after which the National Aviation Authority may allocate some privileges to the drone operator.\n\nDrone operators may ask the National Aviation Authority to assess their organisation to evaluate whether they are capable of assessing the risk of an operation themselves. The requirements to be demonstrated by drone operators are defined in Part C of Regulation (EU) 2019/947. When the National Aviation Authority is satisfied, they will issue a light UAS operator certificate (LUC) and they will allocate privileges to the drone operators based on their level of maturity.

This competent authority will evaluate your risk assessment identifying if the mitigation means you propose and the safety objectives are adequate to conduct such type of operation.\n\nThen you need to apply to the competent authority of the state of operation for a confirmation of a cross border operation, providing them evidences on how you apply the mitigations means to the location and in case how you comply with the local conditions.\n\n*Regulatory reference Article 13 of EU Regulation 2019/947*\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n#### Why I cannot apply directly to the competent authority of the state of operation?\n\nThe authorisation process requires that the authority agrees with the proposal of the operator ensuring the safety of the operation. The level of verification from the authority depends on the level of risk of the operation and on the level of trust on the maturity of the operator. Therefore applying always to the same authority allows to build this trust. Moreover all authorities needs to conduct periodical oversight audits to all operators they issued an operational authorisation or a LUC or received a declaration, being responsible of their national operators is more convenient for both authorities and operators.\n\n*Regulatory reference Article 18(h) of EU Regulation 2019/947*\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n#### When I buy a drone to be operated in the open category or in standard scenario (STS) in the specific category, what should I do?\n\nThe operator is responsible for obtaining a reasonable confidence that the drone he/she is acquiring complies with requirements applicable to its C class 1 - 6 (ref: Annex of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/945).\n\nIn particular, the operator needs to ensure that:\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n#### I am a drone manufacturer and I need to test my product in flight to obtain a Class marking. Do I need to apply for a \u2018specific\u2019 operation authorisation?\n\nNo. A drone under development can be considered \u2018privately built\u2019 that can fly in the \u2018Open\u2019 sub-category A3. In fact, a \u2018*privately built UAS\u2019 means a UAS assembled or manufactured for the builder\u2019s own use, not including UAS assembled from sets of parts placed on the market as a single ready-to-assemble kit.* In this case, the UAS is manufactured/assembled for the manufacturer\u2019s use.\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n## [Drones with class identification label

at least March 2022, it will not be possible to have compliant drones of classes C1, C2 and C3 on the market, due to the absence of the procedures necessary to demonstrate their conformity. In addition, the absence of standards supporting the requirements of R945 until at least the end of the year makes difficult for manufacturers to ensure compliance of their products. This is especially the case for classes C0 and C4 to C5. Therefore, we recommend great caution at least until the end of the year when buying drones with a class identification label.\n\nMarket surveillance authorities are responsible for ensuring that the drones placed on the Union market with a class identification label are compliant to R945. However, you, as individual, should also take measures to get sufficient confidence that you are operating a compliant drone (see FaQ 3).\n\nIf you have any question on compliance of drones with the EU regulation, please [contact us](https://www.easa.europa.eu/contact-us-aviation?select=Aviation&aviation=Drones).\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n#### How as a manufacturer should I demonstrate compliance with the EU regulation?\n\nDrones are subject to several Union harmonisation legislations (e.g. Radio equipment directive 2014/53/EU, Machinery directive 2006/42/EC). It is your responsibility to identify all applicable legislations and demonstrate compliance to those regulations using the procedures defined by each of them.\n\nDrones bearing a class identification label are, in addition, subject to the Union harmonisation legislation set by Chapter II of [Regulation (EU) 2019/945](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02019R0945-20200809) (R945).

Was this helpful?\n\n#### What are the responsibilities of importers and distributors?\n\nThe responsibilities of importers and distributors are defined in Articles 8 and 9 of [Regulation (EU) 2019/945 (R945)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02019R0945-20200809). Sections 3.3 and 3.4 of the [Blue Guide](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52016XC0726%2802%29) provides additional information.\n\nOne of those responsibilities is to ensure that the drone placed on the market bears a class identification label when required, i.e. when intended for use in the open category or under declaration. Therefore, where it is clear that the targeted group of customers will use their drone in the open category or under declaration, importers and distributors should ensure that they only make available to such group of customers drones with a class identification label. Drones made available without a class identification label must clearly target customer intending to operate in the specific category.\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n#### Are drones with class identification label required to operate in the specific category?\n\nAn operator conducting an operation in the specific category must demonstrate that the drone used is compliant with the technical requirements defined in the operational authorisation issued by the competent authority. The technical requirements depend on the level of risk of the operation. For operations with lower risk (e.g SAIL I and II according to SORA) the competent authority may accept a drone with class identification label.\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n#### What can happen to me if I buy a drone with an invalid class indication label?\n\nOnly drones compliant to [Regulation (EU) 2019/945 (R945)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02019R0945-20200809) \u00a0are safe and therefore authorised to be operated in the open category (unless the drone in privately built, [please see the related FAQ](https://www.easa.europa.eu/the-agency/faqs/i-build-my-own-drones-privately-built-open-category)). If you operate a drone in the open category without a class identification label or if it is not compliant with R945 you may expose other people to risk and you may be persecuted by the law. In order to obtain reasonable confidence that the drone you are using is compliant, you must apply the measures described in the FAQ above.\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n## [Model aircraft](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/the-agency/faqs/model-aircraft)\n\n#### Does the new EU Regulation on drones also apply to model aircraft?\n\nYes, the [EU Regulation on drones](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32019R0947) applies also to model aircraft. However, model aircraft are not the main \u2018target\u2019 of the new rules. EASA is aware that aeromodelling is a hobby that has been practised for almost a century by many pilots throughout Europe, with an excellent safety record. EASA is also aware that it\u2019s a hobby that has always been important for the development of aviation technology and attracts young people to aviation-related professions.\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n#### Why have model aircraft been considered the same as drones?\n\nBoth model aircraft and drones are unmanned aircraft and therefore it makes sense that both need to be considered under the same regulation.\n\nWith the inclusion of model aircraft in the EU UAS Regulation, the intention of the legislator was not to introduce new restrictions, but to enable [EASA Member States](https://www.easa.europa.eu/country-category/easa-member-states) to continue applying their current requirements for model aircraft. It explicitly encourages States to do so and provides various options for this, with one important exception: the need for the model aircraft owner to register themselves as UAS operator and make their registration number visible on (or easily accessible within) the aircraft while on the ground.\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n#### What distinguishes a model aircraft from a drone?\n\nThey both have a flying part and a remote control. In addition, both may be used for recreational purposes. In reality, the difference between them lies more in how the aircraft is operated:\n\n\u2022 Pilots of model aircraft are generally more interested in the pleasure of the flight and in directly controlling the aircraft\u2019s flight surfaces.\n\n\u2022 Pilots of drones on the other hand are generally more interested in checking the video being filmed with the on-board camera in the drone and prefer to use automatic functions to stabilise the drone.\n\nWhat is the result? Pilots of model aircraft are passionate aviators and normally quite well informed about the safety rules, especially when they operate within the framework of a model aircraft club or association.\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n#### In some specialised forums we see some discussions on the applicability date of the EU Regulation on drones. Can you confirm that it has been in force since December 31, 2020? Are you aware of any EASA Member States requesting a postponement of the application of the Regulation?\n\nCorrect! On December 31, 2020 the EU UAS Regulation became applicable in all EU Member States, plus two of the [EFTA](https://www.efta.int/about-efta/european-free-trade-association) States: Norway and Liechtenstein. It is expected that it will soon become applicable in Switzerland and Iceland too. The Regulation includes transitional provisions so that certain elements become applicable later and the full Regulation will become applicable on the January 1, 2023. There are no plans to postpone this.\n\nIt is important to note that until January 1, 2023 the EU UAS Regulation does not apply to operations conducted in the context of model aircraft clubs and associations. After this date clubs or associations could receive an authorisation from their State (according to Article 16 of the EU UAS Regulation) allowing them to operate with different limitations and conditions, as set in that authorisation.\n\nTherefore, model aircraft clubs and associations need to address this with their national aviation authorities. Other elements of the Regulation, like the definition of geographical zones, etc. have been already applicable since December 31, 2020.\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n#### You mentioned that the Member States have the power to identify designated areas for the purpose of aeromodelling where drone and model aircraft operations are exempt from some of the \u2018open\u2019 category requirements. What are the advantages/disadvantages of this \u2018option\u2019?\n\nThis is a very flexible tool at the disposition of the States. Depending on their risk, drone and model aircraft operations in some areas in the country may be exempt from some of the \u2018open\u2019 category requirements. This may apply also to mountainous areas where slope soaring flights with model sailplanes are conducted. For example, the Regulation allows slope soaring flights with unmanned sailplanes up to 10 kg to exceed the 120 m limit from the ground, as long as the aircraft remains below 120 m from the position of the remote pilot (see picture below).\n\n![Operations with unmanned sailplanes up to 10 kg](/sites/default/files/inline-images/model%20aircraft.png)\n\n![Operations with unmanned sailplanes up to 10 kg](/sites/default/files/inline-images/model%20aircraft.png)\n\nThe State authorities may create a zone where the limitations are even extended; for instance, the maximum height limit or the maximum weight can be increased. Several of these zones have already been published and EASA is aware of initiatives of citizens discussing with the State authorities to obtain exemptions in some areas. The exemption defined under these requirements is applicable to all pilots operating in such areas.\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n#### EASA\u2019s Basic Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 (as the name indicates) is the top-level regulation that defines the main scope of EASA\u2019s functions and its limits in terms of delegation provided by the European Commission. On this basis, the EU UAS Regulation states in the recitals: \u2018(27) Since model aircraft are considered as UAS and given the good safety level demonstrated by model aircraft operations in clubs and associations, there should be a seamless transition from the different national systems to the new Union regulatory framework, so that model aircraft clubs and associations can continue to operate as they do today, as well as taking into account existing best practices in the Member States\u2019. Has this indication been taken into account? If so, how?\n\nYes! When drafting the legislation, we took into consideration the multiple comments provided by European aeromodellers. This is the main reason why the legislator\u2019 has not introduced new restrictions for European aeromodellers. The regulator offered instead three options to pilots of model aircraft:\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n#### Regarding Article 16 (authorisations to model aircraft clubs and associations), is it in the \u2018spirit\u2019 of the Regulation to have \u2018few and concentrated\u2019 clubs/associations or to facilitate clubs/associations distributed throughout the national territory to access this \u2018authorisation'?\n\nIt was certainly not the intention of the regulator to limit or concentrate in any way access to an authorisation, or bring advantage to certain clubs or associations over others. The intent is to foster a safety culture that has been preserved and encouraged within clubs and associations.\n\nEASA is aware of the very frequent international competitions as well as the importance of model aircraft tourism, also for the local economy (hotels, restaurants, etc.) in some regions. For this reason, the phrase \u2018operations in the framework of\u2019 was used in the Regulation. By requiring the authorisation under Article 16 to apply to operations \u2018in the framework of\u2019, the legislator allows Member States to grant this authorisation to a broader set of pilots than members alone. This also includes, for instance, guest pilots, competitors, and all the persons listed in the authorisation provided by the State. It is decisive that the national legislator is sufficiently satisfied that the pilots operating under this authorisation are aware of and adhere to the requirements under the authorisation. How this is done is for the national authorities (and authorisation holders) to decide.\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n#### In what ways may the requirements for an Article 16 authorisation differ from those for the \u2018open\u2019 category?\n\nThe only compulsory requirement is that related to the operator\u2019s registration. However, with the agreement of the competent authority, even this can be carried out by the club/association on behalf of its members.\n\nEverything else can be agreed between the club/association and the competent authority including height limits, weight limits, age limits and competency requirements.\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n#### Are control line (circular tethered) flights within the scope of the EU UAS Regulation? What about tethered and non-tethered free-flight aircraft?\n\nYes. In general, the EU Regulation applies to all tethered UAS heavier than 1 kg and having a propulsion system. If they are tethered free-flight aircraft (such as kites), the EU UAS Regulation applies only if the weight is more than 25 kg. Changing this requirement would require a change in the Basic Regulation and this cannot be done through an implementing regulation.\n\nNon-tethered free-flight aircraft weighing less than 250 g do not need to comply with any requirement.\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n#### According to the EU UAS Regulation, States \u2018may\u2019 issue national regulations for allowing for model aircraft operations. Can the \u2018national\u2019 Regulation be in contraposition with the \u2018European\u2019 Regulation?\n\nThe regulator included in the Regulation the option for the States to issue the operational authorisation to model aircraft clubs or associations on the basis of either national rules or on procedures established by the club or association, defining the purpose of such procedures.\n\nOther than this, States cannot develop national regulations related to the safety of flights. In case of security, privacy or environmental risk, then the Member States may define additional requirements.\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n#### Can we \u2018Sunday aeromodellers\u2019 report/suggest changes to the Regulation? Who should we contact?\n\nSure! EASA has set up a [webform](https://www.easa.europa.eu/contact-us-aviation?select=Aviation&aviation=Drones) to receive questions and comments from all involved stakeholders. However, it would be more effective if proposals are discussed at the level of the EU associations (such as the European Model Flying Union (EMFU)) so that a consolidated position is provided to EASA. We encourage model aircraft flyers to monitor the [EASA website](https://www.easa.europa.eu/drones) and subscribe to receive news since we constantly publish informative material.\n\nWe would love to hear \u2014 from you particularly \u2014 what we can do to clarify any aspects of the rules, e.g. more concrete articles, webinars, podcasts, explanatory leaflets, more translations, etc. There are a few EASA staff members too who are keen aeromodellers. They would also be more than happy to support.\n\nPeriodically we hold consultations with stakeholders leading to changes to the acceptable means of compliance (AMC) and guidance material (GM). These support aeromodellers in complying with the Regulation. However, it is worth pointing out that modifications to the regulations require a completely different and longer process.\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n## ONLINE SERVICES\n\n## READ MORE\n\n## WEBSITE\n\n## CONNECT WITH US\n\n## CAN WE HELP YOU?\n\n![EU](/themes/custom/easa_foundation/images/eu_flag_small.png)",

You can be both a drone operator and a pilot if you are also the person who actually flies the drone. You can, on the other hand, be a pilot without being a drone operator if, for example, you are a pilot working for a company that provides drone services. In this case, the company is the drone operator and you are the pilot. **If you bought a drone to fly it in your spare time, you are both a drone operator and a pilot**. If you bought a drone to give as a gift, the person who receives the gift and then flies the drone will be the drone operator and pilot.**\n\n### **What types of drones does the regulation apply to?**\n\n**The regulation covers all types of aircraft without a pilot on board, including radio-controlled flying models (powered fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, gliders, RPAS), regardless of whether they are equipped with a camera.**\n\n**A drone is otherwise known as an unmanned aerial vehicle (BSP) which means operating or designed to operate autonomously or remotely without a pilot on board. The regulation concerns;**\n\n* **aerial work**\n* **urban air mobility**\n* **recreational flights, including model airplanes**\n* **international IFR flights**\n\n**RPAS (Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems) is a subcategory of BSP that includes fully autonomous drones that fly completely on their own, without the need for pilot intervention.**\n\n***Regulatory reference: art. 3(3). 30 of Regulation (EU) 1139/2018 / art. 2(2). 1 of EU Regulation 2019/947 and Art. 3(3). 3 of EU Regulation 2019/945.***\n\n### **When is a drone considered a toy?**\n\n**A drone is considered a toy if it can be attractive to a child. More specifically, products designed or intended solely for use in play **by children under the age of 14 are considered a toy and must be** **compliant with Directive 2009/48/EC** on toy safety. The drone's compliance with this directive is declared in the relevant EU declaration of conformity. In case of doubt, the fact that a product should be considered a toy is evaluated by market regulators on the basis of a number of characteristics related to the attractiveness of the product to children, accessibility, etc.**\n\n**However, manufacturers can explicitly exclude their product from the scope of the Toy Safety Directive (when misleading is possible) by clearly indicating a minimum age of > 13 years on their product (packaging, instructions for use, etc.). for example, \"do not use under 14 years of age\").**\n\n***Regulatory reference: Article 2 of Directive 2009/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2009. on toy safety.***\n\n### **What is the difference between an autonomous drone and an automated drone?**\n\n**Autonomous drone is able to perform safe flight without your intervention. It does this with the help of artificial intelligence, enabling it to deal with all kinds of unforeseen and unpredictable emergencies. This differs from automated operations, in which the drone flies predetermined routes defined by you before the flight begins. With this type of drone, it is essential that you can take control and intervene in unforeseen events that the drone is not programmed for. While automatic drones are allowed in all categories, autonomous drones are not allowed in the \"open\" category. Autonomous drones require verification of compliance with technical requirements that are compatible with the system introduced for the \"open\" category. Autonomous operations are allowed in the \"special\" category, where regulations include requirements according to the level of sophistication, respectively. Autonomous operations are also allowed in the category of \"certified\".**\n\n### **Who is an uncommitted person?**\n\n**An uninvolved person is a person who is not involved in the BSP operation or who is unaware of the instructions and precautions given by the drone operator.** Examples of uninvolved people:\n\nspectators gathered at sports activities, concerts or other mass events  \npeople on the beach, in the park or walking on the streets  \nAn uninvolved person is not only a person who is directly exposed to the drone, but can also be a person in a bus, car, etc. if indirectly exposed. For example, if a drone flies over a car, its driver should be considered an \"uninvolved person.\" The reason is that a drone flying near a car (even if it doesn't hit it) could distract the driver and thus cause a car accident.\n\n***Regulatory Reference: GM1 Article 2(18) Definitions, Decision ED 2019/021/R.***\n\n### **Who is the person involved?**\n\n**A person is considered involved if he or she chooses to take part in the operation, understands the risks, and is able to check the position of the drone during the flight. Therefore, in order to be considered a person \"involved\" in the operation, you must:**\n\n* **consent to participate in the operation (e.g., consent to fly a drone), consent must be explicit**\n* **receive from the drone operator/pilot instructions and precautions to be taken in an emergency situation**\n* **not be busy with other activities that would prevent you from checking the drone's position and, in the event of an incident, taking action to avoid being hit.**\n\n**Writing on a piece of paper that a drone will be used at an event is not considered sufficient, as the drone operator must get individual explicit consent and make sure people understand the risks and procedures to be taken in an emergency. During operations, the people involved are expected to follow the drone's flight and be ready to take action to protect themselves in the event of unexpected drone behavior. If people are busy working or watching something during BSP operations that is not consistent with monitoring the drone's flight, they cannot be considered involved.**\n\n***Regulatory Reference: GM1 Article 2(18) Definitions, Decision ED 2019/021/R.***\n\n### **What is a gathering of people?**\n\n**A gathering of people is a crowd of people. It is not defined by a specific number of people, but is related to an individual's ability to move to avoid the consequences of a drone that has gone out of control. If the group of people is so large that the ability to freely escape or move away from the drone is limited, then a gathering of people is considered. Examples of gatherings of people can be considered:**\n\n* **sports, cultural, religious or political events**\n* **beaches or parks on a sunny day**\n* **shopping streets during store opening hours**\n* **ski resorts / ski trails**\n\n***Regulatory Reference: GM1 Article 2(3) Definitions, Decision ED 2019/021/R***\n\n### **What is covered by the regulations in the EU regulation?**\n\n**EU regulations take a risk-based approach and as such do not distinguish between recreational and commercial activities. They take into account the weight and specifications of the drone and the operation it is to perform. The regulations apply to drones sold on the market:**\n\n**For category work \"open\":**\n\n* **those that will bear the class identification label (according to Regulation (EU) 2019/945) from 0 to 6, from lighter to heavier models**\n* **those built privately**\n* **placed on the market before December 31, 2023.**\n\n**For work in the \"special\" category, all drones in this category, including those without a class identification label.**\n\n***EU Regulation 2019/947 takes into account most types of operations and their risk levels. It does so through three categories of operations: \"open,\" \"special,\" and \"certified\".***\n\n### **Can EASA member state maintain national drone regulations in parallel with new European drone regulations?**\n\n**The EU drone regulation is a piece of legislation that became effective in all EU member states on December 31, 2020., replacing national laws and making them no longer applicable. However, European drone regulations provide some flexibility for member states to develop acts that specify certain aspects, such as:**\n\n* **minimum age of remote control**\n* **conversion of certificates issued before the entry into force of the EU regulation**\n* **authorization of modeling clubs and associations**\n* **fines in case of violation of the regulation**\n* **use of geographical zones**\n* **insurance**\n\n**EASA member states may not develop any further drone regulations on a topic that is already regulated by the European drone regulation.**\n\n### **Whether certificates issued in the UK for BSP systems, including pilot training, will be accepted in the EU after Dec. 31, 2023.?**\n\n**The United Kingdom (UK) has withdrawn from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) system as of January 1, 2021. As of this date, EU law no longer applies in the UK, which is considered a third country.**\n\n**This means that in accordance with Art. 41 Commission Regulation (EU) 2019/945 as an operator of unmanned aircraft (BSP), your principal place of business, registered office or residence in is the UK, you are required to comply with Commission Regulation (EU) 2019/947 for operations in the Single European Sky. The competent authority for such third-country operator who wishes to operate in the EU is the competent authority of the first Member State in which you intend to operate.**\n\n**By way of derogation from the above provisions, in accordance with Art. 41 of Commission Regulation (EU) 2019/945, an unmanned aircraft pilot certificate of competence or BSP operator certificate issued by a third country may be recognized by the competent authority of an EU member state, provided that all of the following conditions are met:**\n\n* **third country has requested such recognition**\n* **the certificate of competence of the pilot of an unmanned aircraft or the certificate of operator of a BSP are valid documents for the country where they were issued**\n* **the commission, after consultation with EASA, ensures that the requirements under which such certificates are issued provide the same level of safety as provided by Regulation (EU) 2019/945**\n\n### **Do I need to register my drone?**\n\n**Drones, unless certified, do not need to be registered. You, on the other hand, as a drone operator, must register. You can do this at the EU national aviation authority where you live. In Poland it is the Civil Aviation Authority. You register once, regardless of the number of drones operating in the \"open\" or \"special\" category. The registration will be valid for a period determined by the national aviation authority, after which it must be renewed. However, you do not need to register if you own a drone that:**\n\n* **weighs less than 250 g and does not have a camera or other sensor capable of detecting personal data**\n* **with a camera or other sensor, weighs less than 250 g, but is a toy (this means that its documentation indicates that it complies with the 2009/48/EC Toy Directive)**\n\n**A drone is certified when it has an airworthiness certificate (or limited airworthiness certificate) issued by the National Civil Aviation Administration. In this case, registration is required. A certified drone is needed only when the risk of the operation requires it.**\n\n***Relevant regulation: art. 21 of EU Regulation 2019/947.***\n\n### **What happens after registration?**\n\n**Once you register, you will receive a \"drone operator registration number,\" which must be affixed as a sticker or inscription on all drones you own, including privately built ones. You also need to send it to the \"remote drone identification system.\" In Poland, after receiving the registration number, this number is sent and recorded aytamatically just after positive registrationjo.**\n\n***Regulatory reference: art. 14 of EU Regulation 2019/947.***\n\n### **Will my registration as a drone operator be recognized throughout Europe?**\n\n**Yes, as a drone operator you will receive a unique registration number that will be valid in all other EASA member states. Cannot register twice.**\n\n***Regulatory reference: art. 14 of EU Regulation 2019/947.***\n\n### **I fly model airplanes. How can I fly my model?**\n\n**As an aviation modeler, you have the following options for running your operations:**\n\n1. **You may act as a member of a modeling club or association that has received from the competent authority the authorization specified in Art. 16 of the BSP regulation. In such a case, you should follow the procedures of the modeling club or association according to the permit. The permit will specify all conditions of operation and may deviate from the regulation (for example, it may allow operations with drones weighing more than 25 kg or flying higher than 120 m, etc.).) Member States may allow model clubs and associations to register their members in the registration systems established in accordance with Article. 14 on their behalf. Otherwise, members of clubs and associations of aeronautical modelers shall register themselves in accordance with Art. 14.**\n2. **If you do not wish to become a member of a club or association, you may use the special geographical zones defined by EASA member states in accordance with Art. 15 mouth. 2 of the BSP Regulation, in which drones and model aircraft are exempted from certain technical requirements or in which operational restrictions are extended, including weight or height restrictions.**\n3. **Models can be supported in the A3 subcategory.**\n\n***Regulatory reference: Art. 16 of EU Regulation 2019/947.***\n\n### **Can I fly my drone wherever I want?**\n\n**Each EASA member state defines geographic zones for drones, which are areas where drones are not allowed to fly (e.g., national parks, city centers or near airports) or can only fly under certain conditions, or where they require a permit to fly. Therefore, it is important to consult the national aviation authority to see where you can and cannot fly a drone. Geographic zones apply to all categories. In addition, it is not allowed to fly a drone near or inside an area where a rescue operation is underway.** **We have covered the topic of geographical zones in detail [in this article](https://megadron.pl/pl/blog/gdzie-latac-dronem-mapa-stref-geograficznych-1696862982.html \"Gdzie lata\u0107 dronem mapa stref geograficznych\").**\n\n***Regulatory Reference: Art. 15 and UAS.OPEN.060 (4) EU Regulations 2019/94***\n\n### **Can I fly over people?**\n\n**In general, when you operate in the \"open\" category, you can't fly over uninvolved people unless you have a privately built drone weighing less than 250g or a drone purchased on the market with a Class 0 or Class 1 identification label. In any case, try to minimize the time you fly over people.  \n  \nIf you have a drone with a Class 2 CE mark, in the A2 subcategory, you should keep the drone at a distance not less than the height at which the drone is located (this is the \"1:1 rule,\" i.e. if the drone is at an altitude of 40 meters, the distance from bystanders should be at least 40 meters), and you should never fly within 30 meters horizontally from bystanders. If your drone is equipped with the low-speed mode function and it is activated, you can fly up to 5 meters away from uninvolved people. Distance from uninvolved persons when flying a Class C2 drone in all other cases (drones with a Class 3, 4, 5 or 6 identification label or privately built and heavier than 250 g), make sure there are no uninvolved persons within range of operation.**\n\n***Regulatory reference: art. 4(4). 1 litre. (c) and UAS.OPEN.040 EU Regulation 2019/947.***\n\n### **How high can I fly my drone?**\n\n**The maximum flight altitude in Poland is 120 m from the ground surface (AGL). Of course, it is better to make sure that the national aviation authorities have not introduced a geographical zone with a lower limit in the area where you fly. If you need to fly over an obstacle higher than 120 meters, you may fly at a vertical height of up to 15 meters above the obstacle, but only at the express request of the owner of the obstacle (such as an agreement with the owner to conduct an inspection). In this case, you can fly at a horizontal distance of 50 meters from the obstacle.  \n  \nWhen operating in hilly terrain, the height of the drone above the ground may be lower. Keep the drone at a distance of 120 m from the nearest point of the site. This means that conditions can occur, such as at the top of a hill, where even if you keep your drone at a distance of 120m from the hillside, you are actually flying more than 120m above the valley floor. As long as you keep your drone within 120 meters of the hillside, your flight is legal.**\n\n***Regulatory Reference: UAS.OPEN.010 (2) (3) Annex Part A to EU Regulation 2019/947***\n\n### **Geographic zones, (where I can fly) how do I know if I can fly in a particular location?**\n\n**The flight permit applies to all operations in the \"open\" or \"special\" category and is issued by the authority specified by the State (in Poland it is the ULC). The state may want to restrict flights over a nature park or a riskier area, such as an industrial area or prison, etc.** **Goegraphic zones are not fixed, their areas and permits required for flight may change.**\n\n**You should always check geographic zones and follow them before flying.

There is a ban on flying over gatherings of people. You can fly C0 class drones ( e.g. Mini 3/3PRO, Mini 4/4PRO) and drones weighing less than 250 grams that were launched before 01.01.24 (e.g. Mini 2 SE).\n* A2- Only C-rated drones can be flown. Do not fly over bystanders and keep a distance of 50 m.\n* A3- Maximum weight of the drone is 25 kg. This subcategory also includes all drones weighing more than 250 g that do not have a class and will not get one, as well as drones of our own design.

As a general rule, this minimum distance should be equal to the altitude at which the drone flies (e.g., if you are flying at an altitude of 30 meters, make sure that the nearest uninvolved person is at least 30 meters from where the drone would fall vertically in case of an accident). In no case shall this distance be less than 5 m. In addition, you can fly under the conditions specified for subcategory A3. Avoid flying in areas that have been banned by the state by imposing restrictions on drone flights.**\n\n**Drones with a Class 3 or Class 4 identification label, or that are privately built and weigh up to 25 kg, can be operated in subcategory A3. This means that it is virtually impossible to use them in an urban environment. Keep the drone at least 150 meters away from residential, commercial or industrial areas and operate only in areas where there are no uninvolved people within range where the drone can be operated. In any case, avoid flying in areas that have been banned by the state by imposing restrictions on drone flights.**\n\n### **Who issues the remote pilot certificate of competency for the \"open\" category and how long it is valid for?**\n\n**In the case of the \"open\" category, national aviation authorities (in Poland the ULC) are responsible for issuing certificates.

Thus, unless the operation falls into a standard scenario, it will be necessary to propose possible training to the national civil aviation authority after conducting a risk assessment. The ULC will assess the adequacy of the training in each case, and if it confirms it in the operational permit, it will become the required training.  \nIf the operation belongs to a standard scenario, you must:\n\n* have a pilot's certificate of theoretical knowledge to work in standard scenarios\n* have an accreditation for completion of STS-01 practical training\n\nTo do so, you must complete and successfully pass an online training course.

As a drone operator, all you have to do is submit the declaration to the ULC and wait for confirmation of receipt and completeness. For all other operations in the \"special\" category, an operating permit issued by the ULC is required.**\n\n### **I belong to the \"special\" category, how can I get a permit?**\n\n**First, check whether the operation can be carried out under a standard scenario. If so, you don't need a permit, but you must file a declaration with the ULC. Use a drone marked with the identification label of the appropriate class (5 or 6). Once the declaration is submitted to the ULC, you will receive confirmation of its receipt and completeness, and you will be able to operate under the restrictions of the standard scenario. Otherwise, there are other ways to obtain operational authorization under the \"special\" category, depending on the level of risk posed by the operation in question.**\n\n**As a drone operator, you can apply for:**\n\n1. **Authorize the operation by conducting a risk assessment of the intended operation using a risk assessment methodology; one possible method is SORA (specific operational risk assessment), which can be found as AMC1 in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) 2019/947. This allows you to determine the risk level of your operation and identify the mitigation measures and operational security objectives necessary to ensure the safety of your operation. When you consider that satisfactory measures have been implemented to ensure the safety of operations, you send all the information to the ULC and apply for an operating permit. Once the ULC grants permission - the operation can begin.**\n2. **Authorize operations through a predefined risk assessment (PDRA) as a simplification of conducting a risk assessment by the drone operator. For the operations that will be most common in Europe, EASA will conduct a risk assessment and publish, as an acceptable way to ensure compliance with drone regulations, a list of actions you must implement to conduct operations safely. It is still necessary to apply for a permit to the ULC, but both the drone operator and the ULC will use the standard measures set forth in the PDRA. PDRAs are published by EASA as AMCs to art. 11 of Regulation (EU) 2019/947.**\n3. **Light drone operator certification: this is a voluntary certification, after which the ULC can grant the drone operator certain rights. You can request an organization assessment from the ULC to determine whether you are able to assess the risks of the operation yourself. The requirements you must demonstrate are set forth in Part C of Regulation (EU) 2019/947. The ULC will issue a light unmanned aircraft system operator certificate and assign ratings based on the level of proficiency. These powers may include one or more of the following:-****- conduct operations covered by standard scenarios without making a declaration****- self-issuance of permits for operations conducted by a drone operator and covered by the PDRA without the need to apply for a permit****- self-approval of all operations performed by the drone operator without having to apply for a permit**\n\n***Regulatory reference: article 12 of EU Regulation 2012/947.***\n\n### **What are my responsibilities as a drone operator in the category of \"particular\"?**\n\n**As a drone operator in the \"special\" category, you must:**\n\n* **make sure, the registration number of the drone operator is placed on the drone (e.g., with a sticker) and the same number is sent for remote identification**\n* **develop operating procedures (written procedures are required if you employ more than one pilot as a drone operator, otherwise it is sufficient that the pilot follows the procedures specified by the manufacturer in the operating manual)**\n* **make sure there is no radio interference that could affect the drone's control connection**\n* **designate a pilot for each operation; it is important that it is clear who is the person responsible for each flight-make sure that the pilot and drone support personnel are familiar with the drone operator's manual and procedures, are competent, and are provided with relevant information on any geographic zones published by the CAO**\n* **make sure the maps in the drone's GEO system are up to date, unless you are flying in a geographic zone where GEO is not required**\n* **make sure if you are using a privately built drone that it has a declaration of conformity with the CE class marking, and its class label (0 to 4) is attached to the aircraft**\n* **ensure that those involved in operating the drone are aware of the risks associated with operations in subcategories A2 and A3**\n* **conduct any operation within the limitations specified in the declaration or operating permit**\n* **maintain procedures to ensure safe operations**\n* **prevent unlawful interference and unauthorized access make sure people's privacy is protected**\n* **provide guidance to the pilot on minimizing nuisance caused by noise and emissions**\n* **ensure that the pilot in charge of the operation and other responsible personnel meet all the conditions required for operations in the category \"particular\"**\n* **keep a record of drone operations**\n* **keep the drone in proper condition to ensure safe operation**\n\n***Regulatory Reference: UAS.SPEC.050 EU Regulation 2019/947***\n\n### **What are my responsibilities as a pilot in the category \"particular\"?**\n\n**As a remote control, you must:****Pre-flight:**\n\n* **complete the training and examinations required for the type of operation**\n* **have relevant, up-to-date information on geographic zones published by the ULC**\n* **check obstructions and the presence of people not involved in the operation of the drone (unless operating in subcategory A1 with a privately built drone or a drone with a CE Class 0 designation)**\n* **verify that the drone is suitable for the flight and operations you will be performing**\n* **check that the remote controller is working properly (if applicable)**\n* **make sure that the weight of the drone is within the limit of the category or subcategory of the planned operation**\n* **verify that the operating environment complies with permitted or declared restrictions**\n* **ensure that air traffic services, airspace users and other users are informed of the planned operation**\n\n**When flying in the \"special\" category, you should:**\n\n* **do not operate a drone if you are incapacitated by the consumption of psychoactive/hallucinogenic substances or alcohol, or if you are incapacitated by illness**\n* **keep the drone at a distance so that you can see it clearly; you can use a UA observer to scan the airspace when you want to fly from a first-person view, UA observers must be next to you so that they can immediately communicate if they see an obstacle and give you instructions, such as landing the drone immediately**\n* **if you or an AU observer see a manned aircraft, give way to it and make sure you are far away from it, if there is any doubt about the operation, land the drone immediately**\n* **comply with geographic zone restrictions**\n* **operate the drone according to the manufacturer's instruction manual**\n* **follow the operator's procedure**\n* **do not operate in areas where rescue operations are underway (e.g., stay away from the area in case of an accident, as a rescue helicopter may be required)**\n* **comply with permitted or declared restrictions**\n\n***Regulatory Reference: UAS.SPEC.060 of EU Regulation 2019/947***\n\n### **Whether after December 31, 2023. i will be able to fly my old drone in the category of \"particular\"?**\n\n**Drones in the \"special\" category do not require a class identification label (except when operating in a standard scenario).**\n\n### **Under the \"special\" category, do I still need training, given that I was flying drones before the regulations took effect?**\n\n**Any remote pilot competency certificates issued by national authorities will remain valid until December 31, 2023., after which national aviation authorities will have to convert national certificates to new ones that comply with this regulation.Whether you will have to undergo additional training after that date will depend on the conversion process that the national aviation authority decides to implement.**\n\n**As of January 1, 2024., if you do not have a national certificate of competence as a remote pilot, you will have to undergo the required competency training required for the category \"open\".**\n\n***Regulatory Reference: Art. 21 and Annex Part A (UAS.OPEN.020) and (UAS.OPEN.040) to EU Regulation 2019/947.***\n\n### **I am interested in drone racing and/or flying drones with goggles (FPV) of the \"special\" category, what authorization do I need?**\n\n**Usually drone races are organized by clubs and associations. In such cases, they were able to obtain operating permits from national aviation authorities in accordance with Art. 16 of Regulation (EU) 2019/947, which also covers the organization of such events. If the flight involves spectators, the operation falls into the \"special\" category and an application for permission must be submitted to the CAA.**\n\n### **Is flying with goggles (first person view) allowed in the category of \"particular\"?**\n\n**The regulation allows flights without maintaining direct visual contact with the drone, provided there is a person next to it acting as an UA observer, maintaining direct visual contact with the drone and observing the airspace to ensure that it does not endanger other parties (e.g., aircraft, buildings or people). The UA observer must be next to the user so that he or she can immediately communicate with the user if an obstacle is spotted and issue instructions, such as landing the drone immediately.**\n\n***Regulatory reference: Art. 4 litres. (d) EU Regulation 2019/947***\n\n### **Can spectators stay in the category of \"particular\"?**\n\n**If the event is organized by a club or association that has received a permit from the ULC or the organizer has received an operational permit for an operation in the \"special\" category, then spectators are allowed.**\n\n### **I build my own drones can mine be used category \"particular\"?**\n\n**Privately built drones of any weight may be used in the \"special\" category if they are included in the operational permit issued by the ULC.**\n\n### **I plan to provide services (commercial and otherwise) using drones in the \"special\" category, will I have to approve my operating permit in any other EASA member state?**\n\n**By December 31, 2020. any permit issued by a member state is valid in the rest of Europe. You must first make a declaration (if you intend to carry out an operation covered by a standard scenario) or obtain an operating permit from the ULC.**\n\n**For standard scenario (STS) operations, you must send a copy of the declaration and a copy of the acknowledgment of receipt and completeness to the national aviation authority where you intend to operate. Then you can start the operation according to the requirements of the standard scenario and verify the geographical zone published by the ULC in which the operation is conducted.**\n\n**For operations not covered by the standard scenario in the \"special\" category, as a drone operator you must ensure that the mitigation measures outlined in its original risk assessment are appropriate for the new environment in which you plan to operate or that they need to be updated. You must then provide the ULC with an application for the planned operation, which must include:**\n\n* **a copy of the operating permit issued by the ULC**\n* **the location of the planned operation**\n\n***Regulatory reference: art. 13 of EU Regulation 2019/947.***\n\n### **I am a non-EU resident visiting Europe and I plan to fly my drone in the \"special\" category, do I need to register?**\n\n**All drone operations conducted in EASA member states must comply with the drone regulation, regardless of the nationality of the operator or pilot. Accordingly, as a non-EU resident, you are also required to register with the national aviation authority of the first EU country in which you intend to operate.**\n\n**You will then receive a \"drone operator registration number,\" which should be affixed as a sticker to all drones you own. It should also be uploaded to the \"remote identification system\" of the drone or drones you own. Once registered in the host country, the drone operator's registration will be valid throughout Europe, and the operator will be required to comply with all provisions of the drone regulation.**\n\n**If you intend to operate in the \"special\" category, you must file a standard scenario declaration or apply for an operating permit with the national aviation authority of the EU member state(s) where you have registered.**\n\n**If you wish to conduct operations in a member state other than the one in which you registered, you must follow the same procedure as all other citizens of the member state in which you registered.**\n\n***Regulatory reference: Art. 41 mouth. 1 and 2 of EU Regulation 2019/945.***\n\n### **As a non-EU resident, is my competence in the \"special\" category recognized in the EU?**\n\n**Given that there is not yet mutual recognition between EASA and other countries, in the field of drones, training or qualifications obtained in the country of residence will not be accepted in the EU. Therefore, you will have to undergo the required training before you can fly your drone. In the meantime, other countries may develop regulations that may be recognized by the European Commission as equivalent to those in Europe. Information on future recognition will be published on the EU Commission's website as soon as it is finalized.**\n\n### **What is LUC?**\n\n**BSP light operator certificate (LUC) is a certificate of organizational approval. Drone operators may ask the national civil aviation authority with which they are registered to conduct an assessment of their organization to demonstrate that they can independently assess the risks of the operation. The requirements that drone operators must demonstrate are set forth in Part C of Regulation (EU) 2019/947. Once the National Civil Aviation Authority is satisfied, it will issue a light unmanned aircraft system (LUC) operator's certificate and assign ratings based on the level of experience. Privileges can allow an organization to authorize operations on its own without seeking authorization.**\n\n**Entitlements can be one or more of the following:**\n\n* **carrying out operations covered by standard scenarios without making a declaration**\n* **self-issuance of permits for operations conducted by a drone operator and covered by the PDRA without the need to apply for a permit**\n* **self-authorization of all operations performed by the drone operator without the need to apply for a permit**\n\n### **Who can apply for LUC?**\n\n**You must be an organization to apply for LUC, but you can subcontract some activities.**\n\n***Regulatory Reference: UAS.LUC.010.***\n\n### **Do I need to get a permit before flying a drone? (LUC)**\n\n**This depends on the authority granted by the National Civil Aviation Authority.**\n\n***Regulatory reference: Article 5 of EU Regulation 2019/947.***\n\n### **How long is the LUC valid?**\n\n**The validity of the LUC is unlimited, as long as the organization meets the requirements of the LUC. LUC license may be revoked or affiliated.**\n\n***Regulatory Reference: UASE.LUC.080 EU Regulation 2019/947.***\n\n### **What is the process of applying for an operating permit?**\n\n**If you intend to carry out operations in a specific category in a country other than the country where you are registered, you must first obtain an operating permit from the competent authority of the country where you are registered. The competent authority will assess the risks, determining whether the proposed mitigation measures and security objectives are appropriate for such operations.**\n\n**Then apply to the competent authority of the country where the activity is carried out for confirmation of cross-border activities, providing it with evidence of how mitigation measures are being applied in the location and where they are consistent with local conditions.**\n\n***Regulatory reference Art. 13 of EU Regulation 2019/947***\n\n### **I am a drone manufacturer and I need to test my product in flight to get a class designation. Do I need to apply for a special operating permit?**\n\n**Not. A drone in the development stage can be considered a \"privately built\" drone that can fly in the A3 \"open\" subcategory. In fact, \"privately built BSP\" means a drone assembled or manufactured for the builder's own use, excluding BSPs assembled from kits of parts marketed as a single kit ready for assembly. In this case, the drone is manufactured/assembled for the manufacturer's use**\n\n## **Drones with a class C0-C6 identification label**\n\n### **Are drones with a class identification label available in the EU?**\n\n**Drones bearing a class identification label are gradually appearing on the market. However, the presence of a class identification label on a drone does not guarantee its compliance with Regulation (EU) 2019/945 (R945). Compliant drones are expected to appear in the new year.**\n\n**At the very beginning, few paid attention to the \"classification\" of drones, but as of January 1, 2024, this situation is set to change. From this point on, any drone operating in European airspace (that is not a toy) will be required to comply with certain standards, as required below.**\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Category** | **Class** | **Details** |\n| **Open A1** | ****C0**** | **- weight less than 250 g****- maximum speed 19 m/s** **- flight altitude limited to 120 m -

However, as a user, an individual, you will need to take measures to be reasonably sure that you are using a compliant drone.**\n\n### **How the manufacturer should demonstrate compliance with the EU regulation?**\n\n**Drones are subject to a number of EU harmonization regulations (e.g., Radio Equipment Directive 2014/53/EU, Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC). It is your responsibility to identify all applicable regulations and demonstrate compliance with these regulations using the procedures outlined in each of them.Drones bearing a class identification label are subject to EU regulations set out in Chapter II of Regulation (EU) 2019/945 (R945). Demonstrate the drone's compliance with the requirements of R945 using one of the procedures set forth in Art. 13 R945. The following table outlines the accessibility procedure for each class of drone:**\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **C0** | **C1** | **C2** | **C3** | **C4** | **C5** | **C6** |\n| **Internal production control (Part 7 R945)** | X |  |  |  | X | X | X |\n| **EU type testing and conformity to type based on internal production control (Part 8 R945)** | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |\n| **Compliance based on full quality assurance (Part 9 R945)** | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |\n\n**EU type testing and compliance based on full quality assurance require the intervention of a notified body. The NANDO website contains a list of conformity assessment organizations notified in accordance with R945.**\n\n**After demonstrating the drone's compliance with all applicable regulations, you should:**\n\n* **prepare an EU declaration of conformity in accordance with Part 11 or 12 of R945, referring to Regulation (EU) 2019/945 and other applicable regulations**\n* **provide a copy of the EU Declaration of Conformity (or a simplified version of it) with the drone, on this copy must bear the serial number of the drone**\n* **put the CE marking on the drone**\n\n**These products are subject to the control of national market surveillance authorities responsible for various applicable regulations.**\n\n### **How do I, as an individual, know what is important in an identification label?**\n\n**Although the market surveillance authorities are responsible for ensuring that drones placed on the market in the Union with a class identification label comply with Regulation (EU) 2019/945 (R945), as a user, an individual, you should take the following measures to be reasonably confident that the drone you intend to use in the open category complies with R945:**\n\n* **purchase a drone from a reliable store or online marketplace (in particular, avoid buying a drone online directly from outside Europe, as it may not comply with EU regulations)**\n* **verify the presence of a valid class identification label in accordance with R945: the logo must have the exact shape specified in the figure below, where \"0\" is replaced by the class number (e.g., \"1\"). Any other logo will not constitute a valid class identification label allowing the drone to be used in the open category or under the declaration of.**\n\n* **verify the CE marking on the BSP and the presence of the EU declaration of conformity in the package**\n* **check that the declaration of conformity refers to the R945 and includes the serial number of the drone**\n* **make sure the drone provides the following features:**\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **C0** | **C1** | **C2** | **C3** | **C4** | **C5** | **C6** |\n| **Maximum weight less than 250g** | X |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| **Maximum weight less than 900g** |  | X |  |  |  |  |  |\n| **Maximum weight less than 4 kg** |  |  | X |  |  |  |  |\n| **Maximum weight less than 25 kg** |  |  |  | X | X | X | X |\n| **Low speed mode (< 3 m/s), except for fixed-wing aircraft** |  |  | X |  |  |  |  |\n| **Low speed mode (< 5 m/s), unless tethered** |  |  |  |  |  | X |  |\n| **Indication of noise emissions** |  | X | X | X |  | X | X |\n| **Direct remote identification function** |  | X | X | X |  | X | X |\n| **The function of geographical awareness** |  | X | X | X |  |  |  |\n| **Low battery warning** |  | X | X | X |  | X | X |\n| **Flight termination system, unless tethered** |  |  |  |  |  | X | X |\n| **Function of limiting the flight beyond a given location ( the drone will not fly farther than set)** |  |  |  |  |  |  | X |\n| **Information about the drone's position, speed and altitude** |  |  |  |  |  | X | X |\n\n### **What are the obligations of importers and distributors?**\n\n**The obligations of importers and distributors are set out in Art. 8 and 9 of Regulation (EU) 2019/945 (R945). Sections 3.3 and 3.4 of the blue guide provide additional information. One of these obligations is to ensure that the drone placed on the market bears a class identification label, when required, i.e., when it is intended for use in the open category or as part of a declaration. Accordingly, if it is clear that the target customer group will use a drone in the open category or under a declaration, importers and distributors should ensure that they only make drones with a class identification label available to such a customer group. Drones made available without a class-identifying label must be clearly aimed at customers intending to operate in a specific category.**\n\n### **Do drones with a class identification label have to operate in a specific category?**\n\n**An operator conducting an operation in a specific category must demonstrate that the drone used complies with the technical requirements specified in the operating permit issued by the competent authority. Technical requirements depend on the risk level of the operation. For lower-risk operations (e.g. SAIL I and II according to SORA), the competent authority may accept a drone with a class identification label.**\n\n### **What can happen to me if I buy a drone with an incorrect class designation?**\n\n**Only drones that comply with Regulation (EU) 2019/945 (R945) are safe and therefore can be used in the open category (unless the drone was privately built). Using a drone in the open category without a class identification label, or if it is not R945 compliant, can put others at risk and can be enforced by law. To make sure the drone you are using is compliant, follow the measures outlined in the article above.**\n\n## Summary\n\nLet's put this huge dose of knowledge into your hands so you can understand and comply with the laws and regulations regarding flight, privacy and other BSP activities in 2024. These regulations are designed to maintain security, privacy or protect public interests. The regulations are divided into open and special categories, defining the drone operator, types of drones or specifying when a drone is considered a toy or where it can be flown. It is worth mentioning Class C0-C6 identification labels, which are discussed in depth in the article, and will play a key role in 2024.\n\nWe hope that with the help of this article you already know the answers to your questions, of course, if you have any questions we are here to help and encourage you to contact us.\n\n[Contact us](https://megadron.pl/pl/cms/kontakt-ze-sklepem-megadron-pl-53.html \"Megadron Kontakt\")\n\nShow more entries from [December\u00a02024](/en/blog/202412.html \"Other entries this month\")",

All operators must now ensure their systems are fully compliant with these active regulations. This blog post focuses on the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) regulations that govern all drone operations across EU member states, as well as Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein.\n\n## **EASA drone operator registration requirements**\n\nBefore diving into Remote ID specifics, let\u2019s clarify when drone operators must register with their country\u2019s National Aviation Authority (NAA). Understanding who qualifies as a \u201cdrone operator\u201d is crucial for compliance. The \u201cdrone operator\u201d is the person or entity that owns or rents the drone.\n\nRegistration is exempted only if your drone meets one of these criteria:\n\n* Weighs less than 250 grams (including payload) and has no camera or sensor capable of capturing personal data.\n* Weighs less than 250 grams (including payload) and is classified as a toy under\u00a0[Directive 2009/48/EC](https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/sectors/toys/toy-safety_en)\u00a0(intended for children under 14).\n\nOnce registered, drone operators receive a unique operator registration number valid throughout the entire EU. This number must be physically displayed on all drones using a sticker and entered into each operational drone\u2019s Remote ID system.\n\nPro Tips*Keep your registration current and ensure the operator number is clearly visible on every aircraft. This single registration provides cross-border operational privileges across all EASA member states.*\n\n## **The EASA Drone Classification Scheme ID**\n\nEASA classifies drones based on multiple factors, including weight, capability, and operational risk. The system consists of classes and categories that work together to define compliance requirements. Similar to CE markings on consumer products, drone classes indicate the technical specifications and safety features built into the aircraft:\n\n* C0: Under 250g\n* C1: Under 900g with specific safety features\n* C2: Under 4kg with enhanced capabilities\n* C3: Under 25kg\n* C4: Under 25kg without automatic control (traditional model aircraft)\n* C5 and C6: Specific category operations with certification requirements\n\nThe three operational categories, Open, Specific, and Certified, are based on risk assessment:\n\n* Open category: Low-risk operations, typically for hobbyists and basic commercial use. No prior authorization is required, but strict limits apply, including maintaining Visual Line of Sight (VLOS), altitude restrictions, and limitations on proximity to people. The Open category has three subcategories: A1 (over people with restrictions), A2 (near people with a safe distance), and A3 (far from people).\n* Specific category: Moderate-risk operations that fall outside the Open category (most commercial BVLOS flights) require a risk assessment ([SORA](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/drones-air-mobility/operating-drone/specific-category-civil-drones/specific-operations-risk-assessment-sora)\u00a0or\u00a0[PDRA](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/drones-air-mobility/operating-drone/specific-category-civil-drones/predefined-risk-assessment-pdra)) or declaration for Standard scenarios and operational authorization from the national aviation authority (NAA). Remote ID functionality is mandatory.\n* Certified Category: High-risk operations, such as urban air mobility, passenger transport, dangerous goods transport, and complex urban operations. This category requires full certification, similar to manned aviation, including certified drones, licensed pilots, operator approval, and comprehensive safety systems.\n\nPro Tips*Most commercial drone operations fall into either the Open A3 subcategory (far from people) or the Specific category. Understanding which applies to your mission is essential for compliance planning.*\n\n## **What Is the EASA\u2019s Remote ID Regulation (2025)?**\n\nSince January 1, 2024, Remote ID has been mandatory across EASA jurisdictions for most drone operations. Here\u2019s what you need to know about compliance.\n\n**What Is Remote ID?**\n\nThink of Remote ID as a digital license plate for your drone. It broadcasts identification information that authorities and the public can receive via smartphone applications, enhancing airspace safety and accountability.\n\n**Which Drones Require Remote ID?**\n\nRemote ID is required for all drones operating in the Specific category and all drones with class marks (C1, C2, C3, C5, C6) operating in the Open category.\n\nThe following drones are exempt from Remote ID requirements:\n\n* Class C0 drones: Maximum take-off weight under 250g, including payload.\n* Tethered C3 drones: Must weigh less than 25kg, be electrically powered, attached to a tether under 50 meters, equipped with geo-awareness, and have low battery alerts.\n* Class C4 drones: Under 25kg with no automatic control modes except flight stabilization (intended for traditional model aircraft enthusiasts).\n\nEASA has adopted Direct Remote ID, also known as\u00a0[Broadcast Remote ID](https://www.elsight.com/remote-id/), as the current implementation method. This one-way broadcast system doesn\u2019t require internet connectivity and can be received by anyone with appropriate equipment in the vicinity.\n\nDrones can comply through built-in functionality or add-on modules. Both options must broadcast continuously during flight using open, documented protocols (non-ADS-B or Automatic Dependent Surveillance). The required broadcast data transmission must include:\n\n* UAS operator registration number (with verification)\n* Unique serial number of the drone\n* Real-time geographical position and height above the surface or take-off point\n* Heading and ground speed\n* Geographical position of the operator or take-off point\n* Emergency status indicator\n* Timestamp\n\nThe drone system must prevent modification of all data except the operator registration number, ensuring data integrity.\n\nPro Tips*When selecting a Remote ID add-on module, verify that it meets EASA requirements. Not all modules meet the strict European requirements.*\n\n## **How are BVLOS operations classified under the EASA Regulation?**\n\n[BVLOS](https://www.elsight.com/bvlos/)\u00a0(beyond visual line of sight) drone operations require special consideration under EASA rules. All drones in the Open category must be operated within Visual Line of Sight (VLOS), meaning BVLOS flights automatically fall under either the Specific or Certified categories.\n\nThe Specific category BVLOS operations require compliance with either:\n\n* Standard Scenarios (STS): Pre-defined scenarios with declared compliance, which include STS-01 (VLOS operations over controlled ground area) and STS-02 (BVLOS with airspace observers over controlled ground area). As of August 30, 2024, operators can no longer submit national standard scenario (STS-ES) declarations of conformity in many member states.\n* Individual Risk Assessment: A case-by-case authorization using\u00a0[SORA](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/drones-air-mobility/operating-drone/specific-category-civil-drones/specific-operations-risk-assessment-sora)\u00a0(Specific Operations Risk Assessment) and\u00a0[PDRA](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/drones-air-mobility/operating-drone/specific-category-civil-drones/predefined-risk-assessment-pdra)\u00a0(Pre-Defined Risk Assessment).\n\nThe Certified category applies to the highest-risk BVLOS operations, including urban air mobility (UAM), package delivery in populated areas, passenger transport, dangerous goods transport, and operations over assemblies of people. These operations require the same level of oversight as manned aviation, including certified aircraft, licensed pilots, and comprehensive safety management systems.\n\nPro Tips*Most commercial BVLOS applications, such as inspections, surveys, and agricultural monitoring, operate under the Specific category. Start your authorization process early\u2014obtaining approvals can take several months.*\n\n## **Network Remote ID: The Future of European Drone Connectivity**\n\nWhile Direct Remote ID is currently mandated, EASA is actively developing Network Remote ID requirements as part of the broader U-space initiative. U-space is a set of services and digital infrastructure defined by EASA and the EU to coordinate drones in low-altitude airspace, ensuring safe access while enabling commercial, industrial, and public-safety drone operations to scale.\n\nNetwork Remote ID transmits drone identification information to centralized service providers via internet connectivity, enabling tracking over longer distances, integration with air traffic management systems, coordination of complex missions in shared airspace, and enhanced situational awareness for authorities.\n\nNetwork Remote ID is mandatory for participation in U-space, Europe\u2019s UTM (Unmanned Traffic Management) system for safely and efficiently\u00a0managing drone traffic. U-space only applies in designated U-space airspace, which individual EU states activate when needed. As U-space zones expand across Europe, operators will need solutions that support both Direct and Network Remote ID.\n\nPro Tips*While Network Remote ID isn\u2019t yet universally mandated, selecting connectivity solutions that support both broadcast and network capabilities ensures you\u2019re prepared for evolving regulations.*\n\n## **Elsight\u2019s Halo: Robust BVLOS Connectivity and Remote ID for EASA-Compliant Operations**\n\nCompliance with EASA regulations requires more than just Remote ID. It demands reliable, redundant connectivity that keeps your operations safe and your data flowing. Elsight\u2019s\u00a0[Halo BVLOS communication module](https://www.elsight.com/products/allsight-drone-cloud-management-platform/heatsight-visualizing-connectivity/)\u00a0includes multilink operation that aggregates up to four cellular channels, SATcom, and other RF links into a single virtual tunnel, with advanced traffic monitoring, load balancing, and seamless handoff capabilities.

Exemptions apply only to C0 drones, C4 model aircraft, and specific tethered C3 systems.\n* U-space provides digital air traffic services for drones in designated airspace and requires Network Remote ID.\n* Elsight\u2019s Halo BVLOS communication module provides robust connectivity with built-in Remote ID functionality, supporting multilink, secure, BVLOS-ready connectivity.\n\n**FAQs**\n\n1. **Which drones need Remote ID under EASA regulations?**\n\nMost drones operating in the Open (C1\u2013C3) and Specific (C5\u2013C6) categories require Direct Remote ID. Exemptions apply only to C0 drones weighing less than 250g, C4 model aircraft, and some tethered C3 drones that meet strict technical conditions.\n\n1. **What approvals are required for BVLOS operations in the Specific category?**\n\nBVLOS operations under the Specific category require a Standard Scenario declaration (STS-02) or an operational authorization based on a SORA or PDRA. Approval timelines vary and may take several months.\n\n1. **What is the difference between Direct Remote ID and Network Remote ID?**\n\nDirect Remote ID broadcasts drone identification locally during flight. Network Remote ID sends identification data to service providers via network connectivity. Direct Remote ID is mandatory today, while Network Remote ID will be required for operations inside U-space airspace\n\nTo find out more about how Halo can help you develop your EASA-compliant BVLOS drone platform, please get in touch!\n\n**Related resources**\n\n* [Remote ID for Drones & UAV\u2019s: Ensuring Safety in the Sky](https://www.elsight.com/blog/internal-review-on-remote-id/)\n* [Compliance with FAA Remote ID Regulations](https://www.elsight.com/remote-id/faa-compliance/)\n* [Unlocking the Potential of Remote ID for the Drone Industry](https://www.elsight.com/blog/unlocking-the-potential-of-remote-id-for-the-drone-industry/)\n* [The FAA\u2019s overview of Remote ID regulations for drone pilots](https://www.elsight.com/remote-id/faa-compliance/)\n\nContact Us\n\nAwesome **resources**\n\n[Elsight\u2019s Halo Awarded through U.S. Defense Innovation Unit\u2019s (DIU) Project GI for Reliable Connectivity in Contested Domains\n\nReading time: 2 minutesElsight Selected by the DIU of the Department of War (DOW) for Phase 3 of Project G.I.

To ensure safety and privacy, the European Union has established a **common regulatory framework governing drone operations across all Member States** since 31 December 2020. Below are the key aspects you need to know to fly your drone legally and safely within Europe.\n\n## 1. Drone Operator Registration\n\nRegardless of the purpose of use, registering as a UAS operator in your country of residence is mandatory. This registration is unique and valid across all Member States of the **European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)**. Once issued, the operator registration number must be visibly affixed to your drone.\n\n**Exemption**: Drones weighing less than 250 grams and not equipped with a camera are exempt from this requirement.\n\n## 2. Remote Pilot Training and Certification\n\nYou must hold the appropriate remote pilot competency certificate depending on the operational category in which you intend to fly. The required training varies according to the drone\u2019s weight and category:\n\n  \n* **Open Category A1/A3:** Completion of an online training course and passing a theoretical knowledge examination are required. Familiarity with the manufacturer\u2019s user manual is also mandatory.\n  \n* **Open Category A2:** In addition to the A1/A3 online training and exam, you must undertake practical self-training and pass a further theoretical exam conducted in person.\n  \n* **Specific Category STS (Standard Scenarios):** Alongside the A1/A3 training, you must pass a theoretical examination administered by the competent authority and a practical assessment carried out by a recognised entity.\n  \n\nCertificates issued in any EASA Member State are valid throughout the European Union.\n\n## 3. General Flight Rules\n\nThe following rules must be observed when operating a drone:\n\n  \n* **Maximum Altitude:** Do not exceed 120 metres (400 feet) above ground level (AGL).\n  \n* **Visual Line of Sight (VLOS):** In the Open category and STS-01 operations, the drone must remain within the visual line of sight of the remote pilot. In Specific category operations under STS-02, BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line of Sight) flights are permitted up to 2 km when supported by an airspace observer.\n  \n* **Proximity to People:** Maintain a safe distance from uninvolved persons, in accordance with the applicable operational subcategory.\n  \n* **Minimum Age of Remote Pilot:** 16 years old, although some countries may allow younger pilots under adult supervision.\n\n## 4. Permitted Flight Zones\n\nBefore flying, it is essential to verify that the area is authorised for drone operations. Each country has defined geographic zones within its territory, and it is advisable to consult the official websites of the relevant national aviation authorities to check local requirements and permissions. EASA provides a [dedicated webpage](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones/naa) linking to each authority. Common restrictions across Member States include:\n\n  \n* **Flights near airports or aerodromes:** Operations are prohibited without prior authorisation from the relevant infrastructure managers.\n  \n* **Environmental protection zones:** Authorisation from the managing body of the protected area is required.\n  \n* **Military restrictions:** Many countries have restricted zones under military control, where prior authorisation is mandatory.\n  \n* **Urban environments:** Most countries impose restrictions in urban or densely populated areas for public safety reasons. You must consult national and local regulations applicable to your intended area of operation.\n\n## 5. Third-Party Liability Insurance\n\nWhile not mandatory in all countries, it is strongly recommended to hold third-party liability insurance to **cover potential damages** to others.\n\n## 6. Travelling with Drones within Europe\n\nAlthough you must still comply with country-specific requirements, the harmonised regulation makes it easier to travel with your drone across Europe:\n\n  \n* **Single Registration**: Your operator registration in your country of residence is recognised across all EASA Member States.\n  \n* **Pilot Certification**: Remote pilot competency certificates issued in one country are valid throughout the European Union.\n\n## 7. Need Assistance with Authorisations and Certifications?\n\nIf you want to fly your drone in Europe worry-free, **EU Drone Port** offers a comprehensive **[flight authorisation](https://eudroneport.com/flight-authorisations/)** management service across the EU**,** ensuring full compliance with the applicable regulations in each country. We also provide [**training courses**](https://training.eudroneport.com/) to help you obtain the necessary qualifications, from the Open category to the Specific category, tailored to your needs as a remote pilot.

You can, on the other hand, be a pilot without being a drone operator if, for example, you are a pilot working for a company that provides drone services. In this case, the company is the drone operator and you are the pilot. **If you bought a drone to fly it in your spare time, you are both a drone operator and a pilot**. If you bought a drone to give as a gift, the person who receives the gift and then flies the drone will be the drone operator and pilot.**\n\n### **What types of drones does the regulation apply to?**\n\n**The regulation covers all types of aircraft without a pilot on board, including radio-controlled flying models (powered fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, gliders, RPAS), regardless of whether they are equipped with a camera.**\n\n**A drone is otherwise known as an unmanned aerial vehicle (BSP) which means operating or designed to operate autonomously or remotely without a pilot on board. The regulation concerns;**\n\n* **aerial work**\n* **urban air mobility**\n* **recreational flights, including model airplanes**\n* **international IFR flights**\n\n**RPAS (Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems) is a subcategory of BSP that includes fully autonomous drones that fly completely on their own, without the need for pilot intervention.**\n\n***Regulatory reference: art. 3(3). 30 of Regulation (EU) 1139/2018 / art. 2(2). 1 of EU Regulation 2019/947 and Art. 3(3). 3 of EU Regulation 2019/945.***\n\n### **When is a drone considered a toy?**\n\n**A drone is considered a toy if it can be attractive to a child. More specifically, products designed or intended solely for use in play **by children under the age of 14 are considered a toy and must be** **compliant with Directive 2009/48/EC** on toy safety. The drone's compliance with this directive is declared in the relevant EU declaration of conformity. In case of doubt, the fact that a product should be considered a toy is evaluated by market regulators on the basis of a number of characteristics related to the attractiveness of the product to children, accessibility, etc.**\n\n**However, manufacturers can explicitly exclude their product from the scope of the Toy Safety Directive (when misleading is possible) by clearly indicating a minimum age of > 13 years on their product (packaging, instructions for use, etc.). for example, \"do not use under 14 years of age\").**\n\n***Regulatory reference: Article 2 of Directive 2009/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2009. on toy safety.***\n\n### **What is the difference between an autonomous drone and an automated drone?**\n\n**Autonomous drone is able to perform safe flight without your intervention. It does this with the help of artificial intelligence, enabling it to deal with all kinds of unforeseen and unpredictable emergencies. This differs from automated operations, in which the drone flies predetermined routes defined by you before the flight begins. With this type of drone, it is essential that you can take control and intervene in unforeseen events that the drone is not programmed for. While automatic drones are allowed in all categories, autonomous drones are not allowed in the \"open\" category. Autonomous drones require verification of compliance with technical requirements that are compatible with the system introduced for the \"open\" category. Autonomous operations are allowed in the \"special\" category, where regulations include requirements according to the level of sophistication, respectively. Autonomous operations are also allowed in the category of \"certified\".**\n\n### **Who is an uncommitted person?**\n\n**An uninvolved person is a person who is not involved in the BSP operation or who is unaware of the instructions and precautions given by the drone operator.** Examples of uninvolved people:\n\nspectators gathered at sports activities, concerts or other mass events  \npeople on the beach, in the park or walking on the streets  \nAn uninvolved person is not only a person who is directly exposed to the drone, but can also be a person in a bus, car, etc. if indirectly exposed. For example, if a drone flies over a car, its driver should be considered an \"uninvolved person.\" The reason is that a drone flying near a car (even if it doesn't hit it) could distract the driver and thus cause a car accident.\n\n***Regulatory Reference: GM1 Article 2(18) Definitions, Decision ED 2019/021/R.***\n\n### **Who is the person involved?**\n\n**A person is considered involved if he or she chooses to take part in the operation, understands the risks, and is able to check the position of the drone during the flight. Therefore, in order to be considered a person \"involved\" in the operation, you must:**\n\n* **consent to participate in the operation (e.g., consent to fly a drone), consent must be explicit**\n* **receive from the drone operator/pilot instructions and precautions to be taken in an emergency situation**\n* **not be busy with other activities that would prevent you from checking the drone's position and, in the event of an incident, taking action to avoid being hit.**\n\n**Writing on a piece of paper that a drone will be used at an event is not considered sufficient, as the drone operator must get individual explicit consent and make sure people understand the risks and procedures to be taken in an emergency. During operations, the people involved are expected to follow the drone's flight and be ready to take action to protect themselves in the event of unexpected drone behavior. If people are busy working or watching something during BSP operations that is not consistent with monitoring the drone's flight, they cannot be considered involved.**\n\n***Regulatory Reference: GM1 Article 2(18) Definitions, Decision ED 2019/021/R.***\n\n### **What is a gathering of people?**\n\n**A gathering of people is a crowd of people. It is not defined by a specific number of people, but is related to an individual's ability to move to avoid the consequences of a drone that has gone out of control. If the group of people is so large that the ability to freely escape or move away from the drone is limited, then a gathering of people is considered. Examples of gatherings of people can be considered:**\n\n* **sports, cultural, religious or political events**\n* **beaches or parks on a sunny day**\n* **shopping streets during store opening hours**\n* **ski resorts / ski trails**\n\n***Regulatory Reference: GM1 Article 2(3) Definitions, Decision ED 2019/021/R***\n\n### **What is covered by the regulations in the EU regulation?**\n\n**EU regulations take a risk-based approach and as such do not distinguish between recreational and commercial activities. They take into account the weight and specifications of the drone and the operation it is to perform. The regulations apply to drones sold on the market:**\n\n**For category work \"open\":**\n\n* **those that will bear the class identification label (according to Regulation (EU) 2019/945) from 0 to 6, from lighter to heavier models**\n* **those built privately**\n* **placed on the market before December 31, 2023.**\n\n**For work in the \"special\" category, all drones in this category, including those without a class identification label.**\n\n***EU Regulation 2019/947 takes into account most types of operations and their risk levels. It does so through three categories of operations: \"open,\" \"special,\" and \"certified\".***\n\n### **Can EASA member state maintain national drone regulations in parallel with new European drone regulations?**\n\n**The EU drone regulation is a piece of legislation that became effective in all EU member states on December 31, 2020., replacing national laws and making them no longer applicable. However, European drone regulations provide some flexibility for member states to develop acts that specify certain aspects, such as:**\n\n* **minimum age of remote control**\n* **conversion of certificates issued before the entry into force of the EU regulation**\n* **authorization of modeling clubs and associations**\n* **fines in case of violation of the regulation**\n* **use of geographical zones**\n* **insurance**\n\n**EASA member states may not develop any further drone regulations on a topic that is already regulated by the European drone regulation.**\n\n### **Whether certificates issued in the UK for BSP systems, including pilot training, will be accepted in the EU after Dec. 31, 2023.?**\n\n**The United Kingdom (UK) has withdrawn from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) system as of January 1, 2021. As of this date, EU law no longer applies in the UK, which is considered a third country.**\n\n**This means that in accordance with Art. 41 Commission Regulation (EU) 2019/945 as an operator of unmanned aircraft (BSP), your principal place of business, registered office or residence in is the UK, you are required to comply with Commission Regulation (EU) 2019/947 for operations in the Single European Sky. The competent authority for such third-country operator who wishes to operate in the EU is the competent authority of the first Member State in which you intend to operate.**\n\n**By way of derogation from the above provisions, in accordance with Art. 41 of Commission Regulation (EU) 2019/945, an unmanned aircraft pilot certificate of competence or BSP operator certificate issued by a third country may be recognized by the competent authority of an EU member state, provided that all of the following conditions are met:**\n\n* **third country has requested such recognition**\n* **the certificate of competence of the pilot of an unmanned aircraft or the certificate of operator of a BSP are valid documents for the country where they were issued**\n* **the commission, after consultation with EASA, ensures that the requirements under which such certificates are issued provide the same level of safety as provided by Regulation (EU) 2019/945**\n\n### **Do I need to register my drone?**\n\n**Drones, unless certified, do not need to be registered. You, on the other hand, as a drone operator, must register. You can do this at the EU national aviation authority where you live. In Poland it is the Civil Aviation Authority. You register once, regardless of the number of drones operating in the \"open\" or \"special\" category. The registration will be valid for a period determined by the national aviation authority, after which it must be renewed. However, you do not need to register if you own a drone that:**\n\n* **weighs less than 250 g and does not have a camera or other sensor capable of detecting personal data**\n* **with a camera or other sensor, weighs less than 250 g, but is a toy (this means that its documentation indicates that it complies with the 2009/48/EC Toy Directive)**\n\n**A drone is certified when it has an airworthiness certificate (or limited airworthiness certificate) issued by the National Civil Aviation Administration. In this case, registration is required. A certified drone is needed only when the risk of the operation requires it.**\n\n***Relevant regulation: art. 21 of EU Regulation 2019/947.***\n\n### **What happens after registration?**\n\n**Once you register, you will receive a \"drone operator registration number,\" which must be affixed as a sticker or inscription on all drones you own, including privately built ones. You also need to send it to the \"remote drone identification system.\" In Poland, after receiving the registration number, this number is sent and recorded aytamatically just after positive registrationjo.**\n\n***Regulatory reference: art. 14 of EU Regulation 2019/947.***\n\n### **Will my registration as a drone operator be recognized throughout Europe?**\n\n**Yes, as a drone operator you will receive a unique registration number that will be valid in all other EASA member states. Cannot register twice.**\n\n***Regulatory reference: art. 14 of EU Regulation 2019/947.***\n\n### **I fly model airplanes. How can I fly my model?**\n\n**As an aviation modeler, you have the following options for running your operations:**\n\n1. **You may act as a member of a modeling club or association that has received from the competent authority the authorization specified in Art. 16 of the BSP regulation. In such a case, you should follow the procedures of the modeling club or association according to the permit. The permit will specify all conditions of operation and may deviate from the regulation (for example, it may allow operations with drones weighing more than 25 kg or flying higher than 120 m, etc.).) Member States may allow model clubs and associations to register their members in the registration systems established in accordance with Article. 14 on their behalf. Otherwise, members of clubs and associations of aeronautical modelers shall register themselves in accordance with Art. 14.**\n2. **If you do not wish to become a member of a club or association, you may use the special geographical zones defined by EASA member states in accordance with Art. 15 mouth. 2 of the BSP Regulation, in which drones and model aircraft are exempted from certain technical requirements or in which operational restrictions are extended, including weight or height restrictions.**\n3. **Models can be supported in the A3 subcategory.**\n\n***Regulatory reference: Art. 16 of EU Regulation 2019/947.***\n\n### **Can I fly my drone wherever I want?**\n\n**Each EASA member state defines geographic zones for drones, which are areas where drones are not allowed to fly (e.g., national parks, city centers or near airports) or can only fly under certain conditions, or where they require a permit to fly. Therefore, it is important to consult the national aviation authority to see where you can and cannot fly a drone. Geographic zones apply to all categories. In addition, it is not allowed to fly a drone near or inside an area where a rescue operation is underway.** **We have covered the topic of geographical zones in detail [in this article](https://megadron.pl/pl/blog/gdzie-latac-dronem-mapa-stref-geograficznych-1696862982.html \"Gdzie lata\u0107 dronem mapa stref geograficznych\").**\n\n***Regulatory Reference: Art. 15 and UAS.OPEN.060 (4) EU Regulations 2019/94***\n\n### **Can I fly over people?**\n\n**In general, when you operate in the \"open\" category, you can't fly over uninvolved people unless you have a privately built drone weighing less than 250g or a drone purchased on the market with a Class 0 or Class 1 identification label. In any case, try to minimize the time you fly over people.  \n  \nIf you have a drone with a Class 2 CE mark, in the A2 subcategory, you should keep the drone at a distance not less than the height at which the drone is located (this is the \"1:1 rule,\" i.e. if the drone is at an altitude of 40 meters, the distance from bystanders should be at least 40 meters), and you should never fly within 30 meters horizontally from bystanders. If your drone is equipped with the low-speed mode function and it is activated, you can fly up to 5 meters away from uninvolved people. Distance from uninvolved persons when flying a Class C2 drone in all other cases (drones with a Class 3, 4, 5 or 6 identification label or privately built and heavier than 250 g), make sure there are no uninvolved persons within range of operation.**\n\n***Regulatory reference: art. 4(4). 1 litre. (c) and UAS.OPEN.040 EU Regulation 2019/947.***\n\n### **How high can I fly my drone?**\n\n**The maximum flight altitude in Poland is 120 m from the ground surface (AGL). Of course, it is better to make sure that the national aviation authorities have not introduced a geographical zone with a lower limit in the area where you fly. If you need to fly over an obstacle higher than 120 meters, you may fly at a vertical height of up to 15 meters above the obstacle, but only at the express request of the owner of the obstacle (such as an agreement with the owner to conduct an inspection). In this case, you can fly at a horizontal distance of 50 meters from the obstacle.  \n  \nWhen operating in hilly terrain, the height of the drone above the ground may be lower. Keep the drone at a distance of 120 m from the nearest point of the site. This means that conditions can occur, such as at the top of a hill, where even if you keep your drone at a distance of 120m from the hillside, you are actually flying more than 120m above the valley floor. As long as you keep your drone within 120 meters of the hillside, your flight is legal.**\n\n***Regulatory Reference: UAS.OPEN.010 (2) (3) Annex Part A to EU Regulation 2019/947***\n\n### **Geographic zones, (where I can fly) how do I know if I can fly in a particular location?**\n\n**The flight permit applies to all operations in the \"open\" or \"special\" category and is issued by the authority specified by the State (in Poland it is the ULC). The state may want to restrict flights over a nature park or a riskier area, such as an industrial area or prison, etc.** **Goegraphic zones are not fixed, their areas and permits required for flight may change.**\n\n**You should always check geographic zones and follow them before flying. In poland, you can check the zone at [www. airspace.pansa.en/map](https://airspace.pansa.pl/map \"Pansa mapa\"). Select a view for BSP (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles).

However, there is no minimum age to fly a CE Class 0 drone in subcategory A1.**\n\n***Regulatory reference: Article 9 of EU Regulation 2019/947.***\n\n### **Do I need insurance for my drone?**\n\n**As a drone operator **you must always have insurance for your drone if you use a drone weighing more than 20 kg**. Currently, liability insurance for operators of unmanned aircraft **weighing less than 20 kg is voluntary**. You can find one of the cheapest and most affordable drone insurance policies at [ocdrons.en](https://ocdrony.pl/?affiliates=c20ad4d76fe97759aa27a0c99bff6710 \"ocdrony.pl\").**\n\n***Regulatory reference: Article 14(1). 2 litres. (d) EU Regulation 2019/947.***\n\n## **Open category**\n\n### **How to determine whether I belong to the open category?**\n\n**The drone can be operated in the \"open\" category when:**\n\n* **bears one of the class 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 identification labels**\n* **is privately built and weighs less than 25 kg**\n* **will be purchased before January 1, 2024., without the class identification label, as above**\n* **will not be handled directly over people unless it has class identification or is lighter than 250 g. (Be sure to read the subcategories of operations: A1, A2 and A3 to find out where you can fly your drone)**\n* **will be kept in line of sight (VLOS) or the remote pilot will be assisted by a UA observer**\n* **takes place at an altitude of no more than 120 meters**\n* **does not carry any dangerous goods and does not drop any materials**\n\n***Regulatory Reference: Art. 4 and Art. 20 of EU Regulation 2019/947; Annex Part A and Art. 5(5). 1 of EU Regulation 2019/947, Part 1-5 of the Annex to EU Regulation 2019/945.***\n\n### **I belong to the \"open\" category, how can I determine in which subcategory I can fly?**\n\n**The subcategory is defined by:**\n\n* **a label with the class designation (0, 1, 2, 3 or 4), attached to the drone**\n* **the weight of the drone, in the case of a privately built drone or a drone without a class identification label**\n\n**There are three subcategories in the open category:**\n\n* A1- maximum weight of the drone in this subcategory is 900 grams. There is a ban on flying over gatherings of people. You can fly C0 class drones ( e.g. Mini 3/3PRO, Mini 4/4PRO) and drones weighing less than 250 grams that were launched before 01.01.24 (e.g. Mini 2 SE).\n* A2- Only C-rated drones can be flown. Do not fly over bystanders and keep a distance of 50 m.\n* A3- Maximum weight of the drone is 25 kg. This subcategory also includes all drones weighing more than 250 g that do not have a class and will not get one, as well as drones of our own design. You can't fly over people and keep a distance of 150 m from buildings.\n\n***Disclaimer: to ease the transition, drones without class identification labels may fly until January 1, 2024. as required by art. 22 of EU Regulation 2019/947.***\n\n### **I bought a DJI Mini Drone (weight 249g), how can I operate it?**\n\n**DJI Mini are drones weighing less than 249g, have a camera and are not a toy (meaning they do not comply with the Toy Directive). Accordingly, the following measures should be taken to ensure compliance with Regulation (EU) 2019/947:**\n\n* **As a drone operator/owner, you must register with the national aviation authority.**\n* **After registration, you will receive a \"drone operator registration number,\" which must be placed as a sticker on all drones you own, including privately built ones.**\n* **When using a drone, always follow the requirements of subcategory A1.**\n\n**Remote pilot certification is not required to operate this type of drone, but A1/A3 online training is recommended.

As a general rule, this minimum distance should be equal to the altitude at which the drone flies (e.g., if you are flying at an altitude of 30 meters, make sure that the nearest uninvolved person is at least 30 meters from where the drone would fall vertically in case of an accident). In no case shall this distance be less than 5 m. In addition, you can fly under the conditions specified for subcategory A3. Avoid flying in areas that have been banned by the state by imposing restrictions on drone flights.**\n\n**Drones with a Class 3 or Class 4 identification label, or that are privately built and weigh up to 25 kg, can be operated in subcategory A3. This means that it is virtually impossible to use them in an urban environment. Keep the drone at least 150 meters away from residential, commercial or industrial areas and operate only in areas where there are no uninvolved people within range where the drone can be operated. In any case, avoid flying in areas that have been banned by the state by imposing restrictions on drone flights.**\n\n### **Who issues the remote pilot certificate of competency for the \"open\" category and how long it is valid for?**\n\n**In the case of the \"open\" category, national aviation authorities (in Poland the ULC) are responsible for issuing certificates. Certificate of remote pilot competency is valid **for 5 years**. If the renewal is carried out before the expiration of the certificate, the pilot may attend a seminar organized by the ULC or an entity recognized by it, otherwise competence must be demonstrated again.**\n\n***Regulatory reference: DRONE.OPEN.070 (1) of EU Regulation 2019/947.***\n\n### **Will the certificate of competence for the \"open\" category be recognized throughout Europe?**\n\n**Yes, training conducted in one EASA member state is recognized in all others.**\n\n### **What training do I need to fly a drone in the open category?**\n\n**The type of training required depends on the type of drone being used. A transition period until December 31, 2023 is in effect., and each EASA member state may determine appropriate requirements for remote pilot training in accordance with the following table:**\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **BSP (drone)** | **Operation** | **Drone operator / pilot** |\n| **Class** | **Maximum takeoff weight** | **Subcategory** | **Operational limitations** | **Drone operator registration** | **Remote control competencies** | **Minimum age of the pilot** |\n| **privately built** | **< 250 g** | **A1 (can also fly in A3 subcategory)** | **- can fly over uninvolved people (should be avoided if possible)- ban on flying over gatherings of people** | **not unless it has a camera/sensor or the drone is not a toy** | **no training needed** | **no minimum age** |\n| **0** | **reading the instruction manual** | **16\\*, no minimum age if the drone is a toy** |\n| **older drones** | **16\\*** |\n| **1** | **< 900 g** | **- no overflying of uninvolved people (if it happens, it should be reduced)- ban on flying over gatherings of people** | **yes** | **- reading the instruction manual - full online training - passing the online theory exam** | **16\\*** |\n| **2** | **< 4 kg** | **A2 (can also fly in A3 subcategory)** | **- without flying over uninvolved people - maintain a horizontal distance of 30 m from uninvolved people (this can be reduced to 5 m if the low speed function is enabled)** | **yes** | **- reading the instruction manual - full online training- passing the online theory exam - conduct and declare self-study - passing the written exam at the CAA (or a recognized body)** | **16\\*** |\n| **3** | **< 25 kg** | **A3** | **- don't fly close to people - fly outside the urban area (distance of 150 m)** | **yes** | **- reading the instruction manual - full online training - passing the online theory exam** | **16\\*** |\n| **4** |\n| **privately built** |\n| **older drones** |\n\n****Training of pilots from January 1, 2024.****\n\n**If the sub-category in which you fly requires training you can get one of the certificates according to the EU regulation with the EASA logo and use it to operate your drone in the \"open\" category in all EASA member states.

As a drone operator, you must meet all the requirements of the regulation, and you can only operate in the \"open\" category in the subcategory:**\n\n* **A1, when the maximum takeoff weight of the drone, including its payload, is less than 250 g, and the maximum speed is less than 19 m/sec**\n* **A3, when the maximum takeoff weight of the drone including payload is less than 25 kg**\n\n***Regulatory Reference: UAS.OPEN.020 (5) (a) and UASOPEAN.040 (4) (a).***\n\n### **I plan to provide services (commercial and other) using drones how can I determine which category I can operate in, \"open\" or \"particular\"?**\n\n**In this regard, there are no additional requirements. Prior to the entry into force of the unin regulations, there was a distinction between commercial and non-commercial flights, but with their entry into force this was abolished. You can provide commercial or non-commercial services under the \"open\" category if you meet all the requirements set for the category \"open\".**\n\n***Regulatory Reference: Art. 4 of EU Regulation 2019/947; Annex Part A and Art. 5(5). 1 of EU Regulation 2019/947.***\n\n### **I am a non-EU resident visiting Europe and plan to fly my drone in the \"open\" category, do I need to register?**\n\n**All drone operations conducted in EASA member states must comply with the drone regulation, regardless of the nationality of the operator or pilot. Accordingly, as a non-EU resident, you are also required to register with the national aviation authority of the first EU country in which you intend to operate.**\n\n**You will then receive a \"drone operator registration number,\" which should be affixed as a sticker to all drones you own. It should also be uploaded to the \"remote identification system\" of the drone(s) you own.**\n\n**Once registered in an EASA member country, your drone operator registration will be valid throughout Europe, and as an operator, you will be required to comply with all regulations of the drone regulation.**\n\n**If you intend to operate in the \"special\" category, you must file a standard scenario declaration or apply for an operating permit with the national aviation authority of the EU member state where you have registered.If you wish to conduct operations in a member state other than the one in which you registered, you must follow the same procedure as all other citizens of the member state in which you registered.**\n\n***Regulatory reference: Art. 41 mouth. 1 and 2 of EU Regulation 2019/945.***\n\n### **As a non-EU resident, are my competencies in the \"open\" category recognized in the EU?**\n\n**Given that there is not yet mutual recognition between EASA and other countries, in the field of drones, training or qualifications obtained in the country of residence will not be accepted in the EU. Therefore, you will have to undergo the required training before you can fly your drone. In the meantime, other countries may develop regulations that may be recognized by the European Commission as equivalent to those in Europe. Information on future recognition will be published on the EU Commission's website as soon as it is finalized.**\n\n## **Special category**\n\n### **How to determine whether I fall into the category of** **\"detail****common\"?**\n\n**A drone may be used in the \"special\" or \"certified\" category when it does not meet the requirements of the open category.**\n\n*Regulatory Reference: Art. 4 and Art. 20 of EU Regulation 2019/947; Part A of the Annex and Art. 5(5). 1 of EU Regulation 2019/947, Parts 1-5 of the Annex to EU Regulation 2019/945.*\n\n### **Training requirements in the \"special\" category, whether all pilots in the \"special\" category are required to train to fly a drone?**\n\nFor operations in the \"special\" category, the training depends on the operation you intend to carry out. Thus, unless the operation falls into a standard scenario, it will be necessary to propose possible training to the national civil aviation authority after conducting a risk assessment. The ULC will assess the adequacy of the training in each case, and if it confirms it in the operational permit, it will become the required training.  \nIf the operation belongs to a standard scenario, you must:\n\n* have a pilot's certificate of theoretical knowledge to work in standard scenarios\n* have an accreditation for completion of STS-01 practical training\n\nTo do so, you must complete and successfully pass an online training course. Both the certificate and accreditation can be issued by a competent authority or an entity selected for this purpose.\n\n*Regulatory Reference: UAS.SPEC.050 (d) and UAS.SPEC.060 (b) EU Regulation 2019/947.*\n\n### **Who issues the Certificate of Pilot Competence for the \"special\" category and how long it is valid for?**\n\n**For standard scenarios, national aviation authorities are responsible for issuing certificates. The pilot's certificate of competence is valid for 5 years. If you are renewing your certificate before it expires, you can attend a seminar organized by the ULC or a recognized entity, otherwise it is necessary to demonstrate competence again. For operations in the \"special\" category that are not covered by standard scenarios, the training will be specified in the operational permit issued by the ULC.**\n\n***Regulatory Reference: Article 12 of EU Regulation 2019/947 and UAS.STS-01.020.***\n\n### **Will the certificate of competence for the \"special\" category be recognized throughout Europe?**\n\n**Yes, training conducted in one EASA member state is recognized in all other countries.**\n\n### **Do I need to get a permit before flying a drone in a category \"particular\"?**\n\n**For operations in the \"special\" category, operations can be carried out within the constraints of a standard scenario and using a suitable drone. As a drone operator, all you have to do is submit the declaration to the ULC and wait for confirmation of receipt and completeness. For all other operations in the \"special\" category, an operating permit issued by the ULC is required.**\n\n### **I belong to the \"special\" category, how can I get a permit?**\n\n**First, check whether the operation can be carried out under a standard scenario. If so, you don't need a permit, but you must file a declaration with the ULC. Use a drone marked with the identification label of the appropriate class (5 or 6). Once the declaration is submitted to the ULC, you will receive confirmation of its receipt and completeness, and you will be able to operate under the restrictions of the standard scenario. Otherwise, there are other ways to obtain operational authorization under the \"special\" category, depending on the level of risk posed by the operation in question.**\n\n**As a drone operator, you can apply for:**\n\n1. **Authorize the operation by conducting a risk assessment of the intended operation using a risk assessment methodology; one possible method is SORA (specific operational risk assessment), which can be found as AMC1 in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) 2019/947. This allows you to determine the risk level of your operation and identify the mitigation measures and operational security objectives necessary to ensure the safety of your operation. When you consider that satisfactory measures have been implemented to ensure the safety of operations, you send all the information to the ULC and apply for an operating permit. Once the ULC grants permission - the operation can begin.**\n2. **Authorize operations through a predefined risk assessment (PDRA) as a simplification of conducting a risk assessment by the drone operator. For the operations that will be most common in Europe, EASA will conduct a risk assessment and publish, as an acceptable way to ensure compliance with drone regulations, a list of actions you must implement to conduct operations safely. It is still necessary to apply for a permit to the ULC, but both the drone operator and the ULC will use the standard measures set forth in the PDRA. PDRAs are published by EASA as AMCs to art. 11 of Regulation (EU) 2019/947.**\n3. **Light drone operator certification: this is a voluntary certification, after which the ULC can grant the drone operator certain rights. You can request an organization assessment from the ULC to determine whether you are able to assess the risks of the operation yourself. The requirements you must demonstrate are set forth in Part C of Regulation (EU) 2019/947. The ULC will issue a light unmanned aircraft system operator certificate and assign ratings based on the level of proficiency. These powers may include one or more of the following:-****- conduct operations covered by standard scenarios without making a declaration****- self-issuance of permits for operations conducted by a drone operator and covered by the PDRA without the need to apply for a permit****- self-approval of all operations performed by the drone operator without having to apply for a permit**\n\n***Regulatory reference: article 12 of EU Regulation 2012/947.***\n\n### **What are my responsibilities as a drone operator in the category of \"particular\"?**\n\n**As a drone operator in the \"special\" category, you must:**\n\n* **make sure, the registration number of the drone operator is placed on the drone (e.g., with a sticker) and the same number is sent for remote identification**\n* **develop operating procedures (written procedures are required if you employ more than one pilot as a drone operator, otherwise it is sufficient that the pilot follows the procedures specified by the manufacturer in the operating manual)**\n* **make sure there is no radio interference that could affect the drone's control connection**\n* **designate a pilot for each operation;

Drone operators may ask the national civil aviation authority with which they are registered to conduct an assessment of their organization to demonstrate that they can independently assess the risks of the operation. The requirements that drone operators must demonstrate are set forth in Part C of Regulation (EU) 2019/947. Once the National Civil Aviation Authority is satisfied, it will issue a light unmanned aircraft system (LUC) operator's certificate and assign ratings based on the level of experience. Privileges can allow an organization to authorize operations on its own without seeking authorization.**\n\n**Entitlements can be one or more of the following:**\n\n* **carrying out operations covered by standard scenarios without making a declaration**\n* **self-issuance of permits for operations conducted by a drone operator and covered by the PDRA without the need to apply for a permit**\n* **self-authorization of all operations performed by the drone operator without the need to apply for a permit**\n\n### **Who can apply for LUC?**\n\n**You must be an organization to apply for LUC, but you can subcontract some activities.**\n\n***Regulatory Reference: UAS.LUC.010.***\n\n### **Do I need to get a permit before flying a drone?

LUC license may be revoked or affiliated.**\n\n***Regulatory Reference: UASE.LUC.080 EU Regulation 2019/947.***\n\n### **What is the process of applying for an operating permit?**\n\n**If you intend to carry out operations in a specific category in a country other than the country where you are registered, you must first obtain an operating permit from the competent authority of the country where you are registered. The competent authority will assess the risks, determining whether the proposed mitigation measures and security objectives are appropriate for such operations.**\n\n**Then apply to the competent authority of the country where the activity is carried out for confirmation of cross-border activities, providing it with evidence of how mitigation measures are being applied in the location and where they are consistent with local conditions.**\n\n***Regulatory reference Art. 13 of EU Regulation 2019/947***\n\n### **I am a drone manufacturer and I need to test my product in flight to get a class designation. Do I need to apply for a special operating permit?**\n\n**Not. A drone in the development stage can be considered a \"privately built\" drone that can fly in the A3 \"open\" subcategory. In fact, \"privately built BSP\" means a drone assembled or manufactured for the builder's own use, excluding BSPs assembled from kits of parts marketed as a single kit ready for assembly. In this case, the drone is manufactured/assembled for the manufacturer's use**\n\n## **Drones with a class C0-C6 identification label**\n\n### **Are drones with a class identification label available in the EU?**\n\n**Drones bearing a class identification label are gradually appearing on the market. However, the presence of a class identification label on a drone does not guarantee its compliance with Regulation (EU) 2019/945 (R945). Compliant drones are expected to appear in the new year.**\n\n**At the very beginning, few paid attention to the \"classification\" of drones, but as of January 1, 2024, this situation is set to change. From this point on, any drone operating in European airspace (that is not a toy) will be required to comply with certain standards, as required below.**\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Category** | **Class** | **Details** |\n| **Open A1** | ****C0**** | **- weight less than 250 g****- maximum speed 19 m/s** **- flight altitude limited to 120 m -

However, as a user, an individual, you will need to take measures to be reasonably sure that you are using a compliant drone.**\n\n### **How the manufacturer should demonstrate compliance with the EU regulation?**\n\n**Drones are subject to a number of EU harmonization regulations (e.g., Radio Equipment Directive 2014/53/EU, Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC). It is your responsibility to identify all applicable regulations and demonstrate compliance with these regulations using the procedures outlined in each of them.Drones bearing a class identification label are subject to EU regulations set out in Chapter II of Regulation (EU) 2019/945 (R945). Demonstrate the drone's compliance with the requirements of R945 using one of the procedures set forth in Art. 13 R945. The following table outlines the accessibility procedure for each class of drone:**\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **C0** | **C1** | **C2** | **C3** | **C4** | **C5** | **C6** |\n| **Internal production control (Part 7 R945)** | X |  |  |  | X | X | X |\n| **EU type testing and conformity to type based on internal production control (Part 8 R945)** | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |\n| **Compliance based on full quality assurance (Part 9 R945)** | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |\n\n**EU type testing and compliance based on full quality assurance require the intervention of a notified body. The NANDO website contains a list of conformity assessment organizations notified in accordance with R945.**\n\n**After demonstrating the drone's compliance with all applicable regulations, you should:**\n\n* **prepare an EU declaration of conformity in accordance with Part 11 or 12 of R945, referring to Regulation (EU) 2019/945 and other applicable regulations**\n* **provide a copy of the EU Declaration of Conformity (or a simplified version of it) with the drone, on this copy must bear the serial number of the drone**\n* **put the CE marking on the drone**\n\n**These products are subject to the control of national market surveillance authorities responsible for various applicable regulations.**\n\n### **How do I, as an individual, know what is important in an identification label?**\n\n**Although the market surveillance authorities are responsible for ensuring that drones placed on the market in the Union with a class identification label comply with Regulation (EU) 2019/945 (R945), as a user, an individual, you should take the following measures to be reasonably confident that the drone you intend to use in the open category complies with R945:**\n\n* **purchase a drone from a reliable store or online marketplace (in particular, avoid buying a drone online directly from outside Europe, as it may not comply with EU regulations)**\n* **verify the presence of a valid class identification label in accordance with R945: the logo must have the exact shape specified in the figure below, where \"0\" is replaced by the class number (e.g., \"1\"). Any other logo will not constitute a valid class identification label allowing the drone to be used in the open category or under the declaration of.**\n\n* **verify the CE marking on the BSP and the presence of the EU declaration of conformity in the package**\n* **check that the declaration of conformity refers to the R945 and includes the serial number of the drone**\n* **make sure the drone provides the following features:**\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **C0** | **C1** | **C2** | **C3** | **C4** | **C5** | **C6** |\n| **Maximum weight less than 250g** | X |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| **Maximum weight less than 900g** |  | X |  |  |  |  |  |\n| **Maximum weight less than 4 kg** |  |  | X |  |  |  |  |\n| **Maximum weight less than 25 kg** |  |  |  | X | X | X | X |\n| **Low speed mode (< 3 m/s), except for fixed-wing aircraft** |  |  | X |  |  |  |  |\n| **Low speed mode (< 5 m/s), unless tethered** |  |  |  |  |  | X |  |\n| **Indication of noise emissions** |  | X | X | X |  | X | X |\n| **Direct remote identification function** |  | X | X | X |  | X | X |\n| **The function of geographical awareness** |  | X | X | X |  |  |  |\n| **Low battery warning** |  | X | X | X |  | X | X |\n| **Flight termination system, unless tethered** |  |  |  |  |  | X | X |\n| **Function of limiting the flight beyond a given location ( the drone will not fly farther than set)** |  |  |  |  |  |  | X |\n| **Information about the drone's position, speed and altitude** |  |  |  |  |  | X | X |\n\n### **What are the obligations of importers and distributors?**\n\n**The obligations of importers and distributors are set out in Art. 8 and 9 of Regulation (EU) 2019/945 (R945). Sections 3.3 and 3.4 of the blue guide provide additional information. One of these obligations is to ensure that the drone placed on the market bears a class identification label, when required, i.e., when it is intended for use in the open category or as part of a declaration. Accordingly, if it is clear that the target customer group will use a drone in the open category or under a declaration, importers and distributors should ensure that they only make drones with a class identification label available to such a customer group. Drones made available without a class-identifying label must be clearly aimed at customers intending to operate in a specific category.**\n\n### **Do drones with a class identification label have to operate in a specific category?**\n\n**An operator conducting an operation in a specific category must demonstrate that the drone used complies with the technical requirements specified in the operating permit issued by the competent authority. Technical requirements depend on the risk level of the operation. For lower-risk operations (e.g. SAIL I and II according to SORA), the competent authority may accept a drone with a class identification label.**\n\n### **What can happen to me if I buy a drone with an incorrect class designation?**\n\n**Only drones that comply with Regulation (EU) 2019/945 (R945) are safe and therefore can be used in the open category (unless the drone was privately built). Using a drone in the open category without a class identification label, or if it is not R945 compliant, can put others at risk and can be enforced by law. To make sure the drone you are using is compliant, follow the measures outlined in the article above.**\n\n## Summary\n\nLet's put this huge dose of knowledge into your hands so you can understand and comply with the laws and regulations regarding flight, privacy and other BSP activities in 2024. These regulations are designed to maintain security, privacy or protect public interests. The regulations are divided into open and special categories, defining the drone operator, types of drones or specifying when a drone is considered a toy or where it can be flown. It is worth mentioning Class C0-C6 identification labels, which are discussed in depth in the article, and will play a key role in 2024.\n\nWe hope that with the help of this article you already know the answers to your questions, of course, if you have any questions we are here to help and encourage you to contact us.\n\n[Contact us](https://megadron.pl/pl/cms/kontakt-ze-sklepem-megadron-pl-53.html \"Megadron Kontakt\")\n\nShow more entries from [December\u00a02024](/en/blog/202412.html \"Other entries this month\")",

You can be both a drone operator and a pilot if you are also the person who actually flies the drone. You can, on the other hand, be a pilot without being a drone operator if, for example, you are a pilot working for a company that provides drone services. In this case, the company is the drone operator and you are the pilot. **If you bought a drone to fly it in your spare time, you are both a drone operator and a pilot**. If you bought a drone to give as a gift, the person who receives the gift and then flies the drone will be the drone operator and pilot.**\n\n### **What types of drones does the regulation apply to?**\n\n**The regulation covers all types of aircraft without a pilot on board, including radio-controlled flying models (powered fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, gliders, RPAS), regardless of whether they are equipped with a camera.**\n\n**A drone is otherwise known as an unmanned aerial vehicle (BSP) which means operating or designed to operate autonomously or remotely without a pilot on board. The regulation concerns;**\n\n* **aerial work**\n* **urban air mobility**\n* **recreational flights, including model airplanes**\n* **international IFR flights**\n\n**RPAS (Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems) is a subcategory of BSP that includes fully autonomous drones that fly completely on their own, without the need for pilot intervention.**\n\n***Regulatory reference: art. 3(3). 30 of Regulation (EU) 1139/2018 / art. 2(2). 1 of EU Regulation 2019/947 and Art. 3(3). 3 of EU Regulation 2019/945.***\n\n### **When is a drone considered a toy?**\n\n**A drone is considered a toy if it can be attractive to a child. More specifically, products designed or intended solely for use in play **by children under the age of 14 are considered a toy and must be** **compliant with Directive 2009/48/EC** on toy safety. The drone's compliance with this directive is declared in the relevant EU declaration of conformity. In case of doubt, the fact that a product should be considered a toy is evaluated by market regulators on the basis of a number of characteristics related to the attractiveness of the product to children, accessibility, etc.**\n\n**However, manufacturers can explicitly exclude their product from the scope of the Toy Safety Directive (when misleading is possible) by clearly indicating a minimum age of > 13 years on their product (packaging, instructions for use, etc.). for example, \"do not use under 14 years of age\").**\n\n***Regulatory reference: Article 2 of Directive 2009/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2009. on toy safety.***\n\n### **What is the difference between an autonomous drone and an automated drone?**\n\n**Autonomous drone is able to perform safe flight without your intervention. It does this with the help of artificial intelligence, enabling it to deal with all kinds of unforeseen and unpredictable emergencies. This differs from automated operations, in which the drone flies predetermined routes defined by you before the flight begins. With this type of drone, it is essential that you can take control and intervene in unforeseen events that the drone is not programmed for. While automatic drones are allowed in all categories, autonomous drones are not allowed in the \"open\" category. Autonomous drones require verification of compliance with technical requirements that are compatible with the system introduced for the \"open\" category. Autonomous operations are allowed in the \"special\" category, where regulations include requirements according to the level of sophistication, respectively. Autonomous operations are also allowed in the category of \"certified\".**\n\n### **Who is an uncommitted person?**\n\n**An uninvolved person is a person who is not involved in the BSP operation or who is unaware of the instructions and precautions given by the drone operator.** Examples of uninvolved people:\n\nspectators gathered at sports activities, concerts or other mass events  \npeople on the beach, in the park or walking on the streets  \nAn uninvolved person is not only a person who is directly exposed to the drone, but can also be a person in a bus, car, etc. if indirectly exposed. For example, if a drone flies over a car, its driver should be considered an \"uninvolved person.\" The reason is that a drone flying near a car (even if it doesn't hit it) could distract the driver and thus cause a car accident.\n\n***Regulatory Reference: GM1 Article 2(18) Definitions, Decision ED 2019/021/R.***\n\n### **Who is the person involved?**\n\n**A person is considered involved if he or she chooses to take part in the operation, understands the risks, and is able to check the position of the drone during the flight. Therefore, in order to be considered a person \"involved\" in the operation, you must:**\n\n* **consent to participate in the operation (e.g., consent to fly a drone), consent must be explicit**\n* **receive from the drone operator/pilot instructions and precautions to be taken in an emergency situation**\n* **not be busy with other activities that would prevent you from checking the drone's position and, in the event of an incident, taking action to avoid being hit.**\n\n**Writing on a piece of paper that a drone will be used at an event is not considered sufficient, as the drone operator must get individual explicit consent and make sure people understand the risks and procedures to be taken in an emergency. During operations, the people involved are expected to follow the drone's flight and be ready to take action to protect themselves in the event of unexpected drone behavior. If people are busy working or watching something during BSP operations that is not consistent with monitoring the drone's flight, they cannot be considered involved.**\n\n***Regulatory Reference: GM1 Article 2(18) Definitions, Decision ED 2019/021/R.***\n\n### **What is a gathering of people?**\n\n**A gathering of people is a crowd of people. It is not defined by a specific number of people, but is related to an individual's ability to move to avoid the consequences of a drone that has gone out of control. If the group of people is so large that the ability to freely escape or move away from the drone is limited, then a gathering of people is considered. Examples of gatherings of people can be considered:**\n\n* **sports, cultural, religious or political events**\n* **beaches or parks on a sunny day**\n* **shopping streets during store opening hours**\n* **ski resorts / ski trails**\n\n***Regulatory Reference: GM1 Article 2(3) Definitions, Decision ED 2019/021/R***\n\n### **What is covered by the regulations in the EU regulation?**\n\n**EU regulations take a risk-based approach and as such do not distinguish between recreational and commercial activities. They take into account the weight and specifications of the drone and the operation it is to perform. The regulations apply to drones sold on the market:**\n\n**For category work \"open\":**\n\n* **those that will bear the class identification label (according to Regulation (EU) 2019/945) from 0 to 6, from lighter to heavier models**\n* **those built privately**\n* **placed on the market before December 31, 2023.**\n\n**For work in the \"special\" category, all drones in this category, including those without a class identification label.**\n\n***EU Regulation 2019/947 takes into account most types of operations and their risk levels. It does so through three categories of operations: \"open,\" \"special,\" and \"certified\".***\n\n### **Can EASA member state maintain national drone regulations in parallel with new European drone regulations?**\n\n**The EU drone regulation is a piece of legislation that became effective in all EU member states on December 31, 2020., replacing national laws and making them no longer applicable. However, European drone regulations provide some flexibility for member states to develop acts that specify certain aspects, such as:**\n\n* **minimum age of remote control**\n* **conversion of certificates issued before the entry into force of the EU regulation**\n* **authorization of modeling clubs and associations**\n* **fines in case of violation of the regulation**\n* **use of geographical zones**\n* **insurance**\n\n**EASA member states may not develop any further drone regulations on a topic that is already regulated by the European drone regulation.**\n\n### **Whether certificates issued in the UK for BSP systems, including pilot training, will be accepted in the EU after Dec. 31, 2023.?**\n\n**The United Kingdom (UK) has withdrawn from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) system as of January 1, 2021. As of this date, EU law no longer applies in the UK, which is considered a third country.**\n\n**This means that in accordance with Art. 41 Commission Regulation (EU) 2019/945 as an operator of unmanned aircraft (BSP), your principal place of business, registered office or residence in is the UK, you are required to comply with Commission Regulation (EU) 2019/947 for operations in the Single European Sky. The competent authority for such third-country operator who wishes to operate in the EU is the competent authority of the first Member State in which you intend to operate.**\n\n**By way of derogation from the above provisions, in accordance with Art. 41 of Commission Regulation (EU) 2019/945, an unmanned aircraft pilot certificate of competence or BSP operator certificate issued by a third country may be recognized by the competent authority of an EU member state, provided that all of the following conditions are met:**\n\n* **third country has requested such recognition**\n* **the certificate of competence of the pilot of an unmanned aircraft or the certificate of operator of a BSP are valid documents for the country where they were issued**\n* **the commission, after consultation with EASA, ensures that the requirements under which such certificates are issued provide the same level of safety as provided by Regulation (EU) 2019/945**\n\n### **Do I need to register my drone?**\n\n**Drones, unless certified, do not need to be registered. You, on the other hand, as a drone operator, must register. You can do this at the EU national aviation authority where you live. In Poland it is the Civil Aviation Authority. You register once, regardless of the number of drones operating in the \"open\" or \"special\" category. The registration will be valid for a period determined by the national aviation authority, after which it must be renewed. However, you do not need to register if you own a drone that:**\n\n* **weighs less than 250 g and does not have a camera or other sensor capable of detecting personal data**\n* **with a camera or other sensor, weighs less than 250 g, but is a toy (this means that its documentation indicates that it complies with the 2009/48/EC Toy Directive)**\n\n**A drone is certified when it has an airworthiness certificate (or limited airworthiness certificate) issued by the National Civil Aviation Administration. In this case, registration is required. A certified drone is needed only when the risk of the operation requires it.**\n\n***Relevant regulation: art. 21 of EU Regulation 2019/947.***\n\n### **What happens after registration?**\n\n**Once you register, you will receive a \"drone operator registration number,\" which must be affixed as a sticker or inscription on all drones you own, including privately built ones. You also need to send it to the \"remote drone identification system.\" In Poland, after receiving the registration number, this number is sent and recorded aytamatically just after positive registrationjo.**\n\n***Regulatory reference: art. 14 of EU Regulation 2019/947.***\n\n### **Will my registration as a drone operator be recognized throughout Europe?**\n\n**Yes, as a drone operator you will receive a unique registration number that will be valid in all other EASA member states. Cannot register twice.**\n\n***Regulatory reference: art. 14 of EU Regulation 2019/947.***\n\n### **I fly model airplanes. How can I fly my model?**\n\n**As an aviation modeler, you have the following options for running your operations:**\n\n1. **You may act as a member of a modeling club or association that has received from the competent authority the authorization specified in Art. 16 of the BSP regulation. In such a case, you should follow the procedures of the modeling club or association according to the permit. The permit will specify all conditions of operation and may deviate from the regulation (for example, it may allow operations with drones weighing more than 25 kg or flying higher than 120 m, etc.).) Member States may allow model clubs and associations to register their members in the registration systems established in accordance with Article. 14 on their behalf. Otherwise, members of clubs and associations of aeronautical modelers shall register themselves in accordance with Art. 14.**\n2. **If you do not wish to become a member of a club or association, you may use the special geographical zones defined by EASA member states in accordance with Art. 15 mouth. 2 of the BSP Regulation, in which drones and model aircraft are exempted from certain technical requirements or in which operational restrictions are extended, including weight or height restrictions.**\n3. **Models can be supported in the A3 subcategory.**\n\n***Regulatory reference: Art. 16 of EU Regulation 2019/947.***\n\n### **Can I fly my drone wherever I want?**\n\n**Each EASA member state defines geographic zones for drones, which are areas where drones are not allowed to fly (e.g., national parks, city centers or near airports) or can only fly under certain conditions, or where they require a permit to fly. Therefore, it is important to consult the national aviation authority to see where you can and cannot fly a drone. Geographic zones apply to all categories. In addition, it is not allowed to fly a drone near or inside an area where a rescue operation is underway.** **We have covered the topic of geographical zones in detail [in this article](https://megadron.pl/pl/blog/gdzie-latac-dronem-mapa-stref-geograficznych-1696862982.html \"Gdzie lata\u0107 dronem mapa stref geograficznych\").**\n\n***Regulatory Reference: Art. 15 and UAS.OPEN.060 (4) EU Regulations 2019/94***\n\n### **Can I fly over people?**\n\n**In general, when you operate in the \"open\" category, you can't fly over uninvolved people unless you have a privately built drone weighing less than 250g or a drone purchased on the market with a Class 0 or Class 1 identification label. In any case, try to minimize the time you fly over people.  \n  \nIf you have a drone with a Class 2 CE mark, in the A2 subcategory, you should keep the drone at a distance not less than the height at which the drone is located (this is the \"1:1 rule,\" i.e. if the drone is at an altitude of 40 meters, the distance from bystanders should be at least 40 meters), and you should never fly within 30 meters horizontally from bystanders. If your drone is equipped with the low-speed mode function and it is activated, you can fly up to 5 meters away from uninvolved people. Distance from uninvolved persons when flying a Class C2 drone in all other cases (drones with a Class 3, 4, 5 or 6 identification label or privately built and heavier than 250 g), make sure there are no uninvolved persons within range of operation.**\n\n***Regulatory reference: art. 4(4). 1 litre. (c) and UAS.OPEN.040 EU Regulation 2019/947.***\n\n### **How high can I fly my drone?**\n\n**The maximum flight altitude in Poland is 120 m from the ground surface (AGL). Of course, it is better to make sure that the national aviation authorities have not introduced a geographical zone with a lower limit in the area where you fly. If you need to fly over an obstacle higher than 120 meters, you may fly at a vertical height of up to 15 meters above the obstacle, but only at the express request of the owner of the obstacle (such as an agreement with the owner to conduct an inspection). In this case, you can fly at a horizontal distance of 50 meters from the obstacle.  \n  \nWhen operating in hilly terrain, the height of the drone above the ground may be lower. Keep the drone at a distance of 120 m from the nearest point of the site. This means that conditions can occur, such as at the top of a hill, where even if you keep your drone at a distance of 120m from the hillside, you are actually flying more than 120m above the valley floor. As long as you keep your drone within 120 meters of the hillside, your flight is legal.**\n\n***Regulatory Reference: UAS.OPEN.010 (2) (3) Annex Part A to EU Regulation 2019/947***\n\n### **Geographic zones, (where I can fly) how do I know if I can fly in a particular location?**\n\n**The flight permit applies to all operations in the \"open\" or \"special\" category and is issued by the authority specified by the State (in Poland it is the ULC). The state may want to restrict flights over a nature park or a riskier area, such as an industrial area or prison, etc.** **Goegraphic zones are not fixed, their areas and permits required for flight may change.**\n\n**You should always check geographic zones and follow them before flying.

However, there is no minimum age to fly a CE Class 0 drone in subcategory A1.**\n\n***Regulatory reference: Article 9 of EU Regulation 2019/947.***\n\n### **Do I need insurance for my drone?**\n\n**As a drone operator **you must always have insurance for your drone if you use a drone weighing more than 20 kg**. Currently, liability insurance for operators of unmanned aircraft **weighing less than 20 kg is voluntary**. You can find one of the cheapest and most affordable drone insurance policies at [ocdrons.en](https://ocdrony.pl/?affiliates=c20ad4d76fe97759aa27a0c99bff6710 \"ocdrony.pl\").**\n\n***Regulatory reference: Article 14(1). 2 litres.

There is a ban on flying over gatherings of people. You can fly C0 class drones ( e.g. Mini 3/3PRO, Mini 4/4PRO) and drones weighing less than 250 grams that were launched before 01.01.24 (e.g. Mini 2 SE).\n* A2- Only C-rated drones can be flown. Do not fly over bystanders and keep a distance of 50 m.\n* A3- Maximum weight of the drone is 25 kg. This subcategory also includes all drones weighing more than 250 g that do not have a class and will not get one, as well as drones of our own design. You can't fly over people and keep a distance of 150 m from buildings.\n\n***Disclaimer: to ease the transition, drones without class identification labels may fly until January 1, 2024. as required by art. 22 of EU Regulation 2019/947.***\n\n### **I bought a DJI Mini Drone (weight 249g), how can I operate it?**\n\n**DJI Mini are drones weighing less than 249g, have a camera and are not a toy (meaning they do not comply with the Toy Directive). Accordingly, the following measures should be taken to ensure compliance with Regulation (EU) 2019/947:**\n\n* **As a drone operator/owner, you must register with the national aviation authority.**\n* **After registration, you will receive a \"drone operator registration number,\" which must be placed as a sticker on all drones you own, including privately built ones.**\n* **When using a drone, always follow the requirements of subcategory A1.**\n\n**Remote pilot certification is not required to operate this type of drone, but A1/A3 online training is recommended.

As a general rule, this minimum distance should be equal to the altitude at which the drone flies (e.g., if you are flying at an altitude of 30 meters, make sure that the nearest uninvolved person is at least 30 meters from where the drone would fall vertically in case of an accident). In no case shall this distance be less than 5 m. In addition, you can fly under the conditions specified for subcategory A3. Avoid flying in areas that have been banned by the state by imposing restrictions on drone flights.**\n\n**Drones with a Class 3 or Class 4 identification label, or that are privately built and weigh up to 25 kg, can be operated in subcategory A3. This means that it is virtually impossible to use them in an urban environment. Keep the drone at least 150 meters away from residential, commercial or industrial areas and operate only in areas where there are no uninvolved people within range where the drone can be operated. In any case, avoid flying in areas that have been banned by the state by imposing restrictions on drone flights.**\n\n### **Who issues the remote pilot certificate of competency for the \"open\" category and how long it is valid for?**\n\n**In the case of the \"open\" category, national aviation authorities (in Poland the ULC) are responsible for issuing certificates. Certificate of remote pilot competency is valid **for 5 years**. If the renewal is carried out before the expiration of the certificate, the pilot may attend a seminar organized by the ULC or an entity recognized by it, otherwise competence must be demonstrated again.**\n\n***Regulatory reference: DRONE.OPEN.070 (1) of EU Regulation 2019/947.***\n\n### **Will the certificate of competence for the \"open\" category be recognized throughout Europe?**\n\n**Yes, training conducted in one EASA member state is recognized in all others.**\n\n### **What training do I need to fly a drone in the open category?**\n\n**The type of training required depends on the type of drone being used.

You can provide commercial or non-commercial services under the \"open\" category if you meet all the requirements set for the category \"open\".**\n\n***Regulatory Reference: Art. 4 of EU Regulation 2019/947; Annex Part A and Art. 5(5). 1 of EU Regulation 2019/947.***\n\n### **I am a non-EU resident visiting Europe and plan to fly my drone in the \"open\" category, do I need to register?**\n\n**All drone operations conducted in EASA member states must comply with the drone regulation, regardless of the nationality of the operator or pilot. Accordingly, as a non-EU resident, you are also required to register with the national aviation authority of the first EU country in which you intend to operate.**\n\n**You will then receive a \"drone operator registration number,\" which should be affixed as a sticker to all drones you own. It should also be uploaded to the \"remote identification system\" of the drone(s) you own.**\n\n**Once registered in an EASA member country, your drone operator registration will be valid throughout Europe, and as an operator, you will be required to comply with all regulations of the drone regulation.**\n\n**If you intend to operate in the \"special\" category, you must file a standard scenario declaration or apply for an operating permit with the national aviation authority of the EU member state where you have registered.If you wish to conduct operations in a member state other than the one in which you registered, you must follow the same procedure as all other citizens of the member state in which you registered.**\n\n***Regulatory reference: Art. 41 mouth. 1 and 2 of EU Regulation 2019/945.***\n\n### **As a non-EU resident, are my competencies in the \"open\" category recognized in the EU?**\n\n**Given that there is not yet mutual recognition between EASA and other countries, in the field of drones, training or qualifications obtained in the country of residence will not be accepted in the EU. Therefore, you will have to undergo the required training before you can fly your drone. In the meantime, other countries may develop regulations that may be recognized by the European Commission as equivalent to those in Europe. Information on future recognition will be published on the EU Commission's website as soon as it is finalized.**\n\n## **Special category**\n\n### **How to determine whether I fall into the category of** **\"detail****common\"?**\n\n**A drone may be used in the \"special\" or \"certified\" category when it does not meet the requirements of the open category.**\n\n*Regulatory Reference: Art. 4 and Art. 20 of EU Regulation 2019/947; Part A of the Annex and Art. 5(5). 1 of EU Regulation 2019/947, Parts 1-5 of the Annex to EU Regulation 2019/945.*\n\n### **Training requirements in the \"special\" category, whether all pilots in the \"special\" category are required to train to fly a drone?**\n\nFor operations in the \"special\" category, the training depends on the operation you intend to carry out. Thus, unless the operation falls into a standard scenario, it will be necessary to propose possible training to the national civil aviation authority after conducting a risk assessment. The ULC will assess the adequacy of the training in each case, and if it confirms it in the operational permit, it will become the required training.  \nIf the operation belongs to a standard scenario, you must:\n\n* have a pilot's certificate of theoretical knowledge to work in standard scenarios\n* have an accreditation for completion of STS-01 practical training\n\nTo do so, you must complete and successfully pass an online training course. Both the certificate and accreditation can be issued by a competent authority or an entity selected for this purpose.\n\n*Regulatory Reference: UAS.SPEC.050 (d) and UAS.SPEC.060 (b) EU Regulation 2019/947.*\n\n### **Who issues the Certificate of Pilot Competence for the \"special\" category and how long it is valid for?**\n\n**For standard scenarios, national aviation authorities are responsible for issuing certificates. The pilot's certificate of competence is valid for 5 years. If you are renewing your certificate before it expires, you can attend a seminar organized by the ULC or a recognized entity, otherwise it is necessary to demonstrate competence again. For operations in the \"special\" category that are not covered by standard scenarios, the training will be specified in the operational permit issued by the ULC.**\n\n***Regulatory Reference: Article 12 of EU Regulation 2019/947 and UAS.STS-01.020.***\n\n### **Will the certificate of competence for the \"special\" category be recognized throughout Europe?**\n\n**Yes, training conducted in one EASA member state is recognized in all other countries.**\n\n### **Do I need to get a permit before flying a drone in a category \"particular\"?**\n\n**For operations in the \"special\" category, operations can be carried out within the constraints of a standard scenario and using a suitable drone. As a drone operator, all you have to do is submit the declaration to the ULC and wait for confirmation of receipt and completeness. For all other operations in the \"special\" category, an operating permit issued by the ULC is required.**\n\n### **I belong to the \"special\" category, how can I get a permit?**\n\n**First, check whether the operation can be carried out under a standard scenario. If so, you don't need a permit, but you must file a declaration with the ULC. Use a drone marked with the identification label of the appropriate class (5 or 6). Once the declaration is submitted to the ULC, you will receive confirmation of its receipt and completeness, and you will be able to operate under the restrictions of the standard scenario. Otherwise, there are other ways to obtain operational authorization under the \"special\" category, depending on the level of risk posed by the operation in question.**\n\n**As a drone operator, you can apply for:**\n\n1. **Authorize the operation by conducting a risk assessment of the intended operation using a risk assessment methodology; one possible method is SORA (specific operational risk assessment), which can be found as AMC1 in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) 2019/947. This allows you to determine the risk level of your operation and identify the mitigation measures and operational security objectives necessary to ensure the safety of your operation. When you consider that satisfactory measures have been implemented to ensure the safety of operations, you send all the information to the ULC and apply for an operating permit. Once the ULC grants permission - the operation can begin.**\n2. **Authorize operations through a predefined risk assessment (PDRA) as a simplification of conducting a risk assessment by the drone operator. For the operations that will be most common in Europe, EASA will conduct a risk assessment and publish, as an acceptable way to ensure compliance with drone regulations, a list of actions you must implement to conduct operations safely. It is still necessary to apply for a permit to the ULC, but both the drone operator and the ULC will use the standard measures set forth in the PDRA. PDRAs are published by EASA as AMCs to art. 11 of Regulation (EU) 2019/947.**\n3. **Light drone operator certification: this is a voluntary certification, after which the ULC can grant the drone operator certain rights. You can request an organization assessment from the ULC to determine whether you are able to assess the risks of the operation yourself. The requirements you must demonstrate are set forth in Part C of Regulation (EU) 2019/947. The ULC will issue a light unmanned aircraft system operator certificate and assign ratings based on the level of proficiency. These powers may include one or more of the following:-****- conduct operations covered by standard scenarios without making a declaration****- self-issuance of permits for operations conducted by a drone operator and covered by the PDRA without the need to apply for a permit****- self-approval of all operations performed by the drone operator without having to apply for a permit**\n\n***Regulatory reference: article 12 of EU Regulation 2012/947.***\n\n### **What are my responsibilities as a drone operator in the category of \"particular\"?**\n\n**As a drone operator in the \"special\" category, you must:**\n\n* **make sure, the registration number of the drone operator is placed on the drone (e.g., with a sticker) and the same number is sent for remote identification**\n* **develop operating procedures (written procedures are required if you employ more than one pilot as a drone operator, otherwise it is sufficient that the pilot follows the procedures specified by the manufacturer in the operating manual)**\n* **make sure there is no radio interference that could affect the drone's control connection**\n* **designate a pilot for each operation; it is important that it is clear who is the person responsible for each flight-make sure that the pilot and drone support personnel are familiar with the drone operator's manual and procedures, are competent, and are provided with relevant information on any geographic zones published by the CAO**\n* **make sure the maps in the drone's GEO system are up to date, unless you are flying in a geographic zone where GEO is not required**\n* **make sure if you are using a privately built drone that it has a declaration of conformity with the CE class marking, and its class label (0 to 4) is attached to the aircraft**\n* **ensure that those involved in operating the drone are aware of the risks associated with operations in subcategories A2 and A3**\n* **conduct any operation within the limitations specified in the declaration or operating permit**\n* **maintain procedures to ensure safe operations**\n* **prevent unlawful interference and unauthorized access make sure people's privacy is protected**\n* **provide guidance to the pilot on minimizing nuisance caused by noise and emissions**\n* **ensure that the pilot in charge of the operation and other responsible personnel meet all the conditions required for operations in the category \"particular\"**\n* **keep a record of drone operations**\n* **keep the drone in proper condition to ensure safe operation**\n\n***Regulatory Reference: UAS.SPEC.050 EU Regulation 2019/947***\n\n### **What are my responsibilities as a pilot in the category \"particular\"?**\n\n**As a remote control, you must:****Pre-flight:**\n\n* **complete the training and examinations required for the type of operation**\n* **have relevant, up-to-date information on geographic zones published by the ULC**\n* **check obstructions and the presence of people not involved in the operation of the drone (unless operating in subcategory A1 with a privately built drone or a drone with a CE Class 0 designation)**\n* **verify that the drone is suitable for the flight and operations you will be performing**\n* **check that the remote controller is working properly (if applicable)**\n* **make sure that the weight of the drone is within the limit of the category or subcategory of the planned operation**\n* **verify that the operating environment complies with permitted or declared restrictions**\n* **ensure that air traffic services, airspace users and other users are informed of the planned operation**\n\n**When flying in the \"special\" category, you should:**\n\n* **do not operate a drone if you are incapacitated by the consumption of psychoactive/hallucinogenic substances or alcohol, or if you are incapacitated by illness**\n* **keep the drone at a distance so that you can see it clearly;

Information on future recognition will be published on the EU Commission's website as soon as it is finalized.**\n\n### **What is LUC?**\n\n**BSP light operator certificate (LUC) is a certificate of organizational approval. Drone operators may ask the national civil aviation authority with which they are registered to conduct an assessment of their organization to demonstrate that they can independently assess the risks of the operation. The requirements that drone operators must demonstrate are set forth in Part C of Regulation (EU) 2019/947. Once the National Civil Aviation Authority is satisfied, it will issue a light unmanned aircraft system (LUC) operator's certificate and assign ratings based on the level of experience. Privileges can allow an organization to authorize operations on its own without seeking authorization.**\n\n**Entitlements can be one or more of the following:**\n\n* **carrying out operations covered by standard scenarios without making a declaration**\n* **self-issuance of permits for operations conducted by a drone operator and covered by the PDRA without the need to apply for a permit**\n* **self-authorization of all operations performed by the drone operator without the need to apply for a permit**\n\n### **Who can apply for LUC?**\n\n**You must be an organization to apply for LUC, but you can subcontract some activities.**\n\n***Regulatory Reference: UAS.LUC.010.***\n\n### **Do I need to get a permit before flying a drone?

The competent authority will assess the risks, determining whether the proposed mitigation measures and security objectives are appropriate for such operations.**\n\n**Then apply to the competent authority of the country where the activity is carried out for confirmation of cross-border activities, providing it with evidence of how mitigation measures are being applied in the location and where they are consistent with local conditions.**\n\n***Regulatory reference Art. 13 of EU Regulation 2019/947***\n\n### **I am a drone manufacturer and I need to test my product in flight to get a class designation. Do I need to apply for a special operating permit?**\n\n**Not. A drone in the development stage can be considered a \"privately built\" drone that can fly in the A3 \"open\" subcategory. In fact, \"privately built BSP\" means a drone assembled or manufactured for the builder's own use, excluding BSPs assembled from kits of parts marketed as a single kit ready for assembly. In this case, the drone is manufactured/assembled for the manufacturer's use**\n\n## **Drones with a class C0-C6 identification label**\n\n### **Are drones with a class identification label available in the EU?**\n\n**Drones bearing a class identification label are gradually appearing on the market. However, the presence of a class identification label on a drone does not guarantee its compliance with Regulation (EU) 2019/945 (R945). Compliant drones are expected to appear in the new year.**\n\n**At the very beginning, few paid attention to the \"classification\" of drones, but as of January 1, 2024, this situation is set to change.

One of these obligations is to ensure that the drone placed on the market bears a class identification label, when required, i.e., when it is intended for use in the open category or as part of a declaration. Accordingly, if it is clear that the target customer group will use a drone in the open category or under a declaration, importers and distributors should ensure that they only make drones with a class identification label available to such a customer group. Drones made available without a class-identifying label must be clearly aimed at customers intending to operate in a specific category.**\n\n### **Do drones with a class identification label have to operate in a specific category?**\n\n**An operator conducting an operation in a specific category must demonstrate that the drone used complies with the technical requirements specified in the operating permit issued by the competent authority. Technical requirements depend on the risk level of the operation. For lower-risk operations (e.g. SAIL I and II according to SORA), the competent authority may accept a drone with a class identification label.**\n\n### **What can happen to me if I buy a drone with an incorrect class designation?**\n\n**Only drones that comply with Regulation (EU) 2019/945 (R945) are safe and therefore can be used in the open category (unless the drone was privately built). Using a drone in the open category without a class identification label, or if it is not R945 compliant, can put others at risk and can be enforced by law. To make sure the drone you are using is compliant, follow the measures outlined in the article above.**\n\n## Summary\n\nLet's put this huge dose of knowledge into your hands so you can understand and comply with the laws and regulations regarding flight, privacy and other BSP activities in 2024. These regulations are designed to maintain security, privacy or protect public interests. The regulations are divided into open and special categories, defining the drone operator, types of drones or specifying when a drone is considered a toy or where it can be flown. It is worth mentioning Class C0-C6 identification labels, which are discussed in depth in the article, and will play a key role in 2024.\n\nWe hope that with the help of this article you already know the answers to your questions, of course, if you have any questions we are here to help and encourage you to contact us.\n\n[Contact us](https://megadron.pl/pl/cms/kontakt-ze-sklepem-megadron-pl-53.html \"Megadron Kontakt\")\n\nShow more entries from [December\u00a02024](/en/blog/202412.html \"Other entries this month\")",

    "summary": "The European Union's drone regulation framework, established through Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/947 and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/945, governs drone flight authorization applications within EASA national aviation authorities. This framework categorizes operations into Open, Specific, and Certified categories based on risk assessment. The Open category includes subcategories A1, A2, and A3, each with distinct operational restrictions such as maximum weights and altitude limits. Remote pilot competency requirements vary among these subcategories, with A2 necessitating additional theoretical knowledge and practical skill demonstration compared to A1 and A3. For Specific category operations, authorization from national aviation authorities is mandatory, requiring detailed operational documentation and safety case development. Key regulatory obligations include drone registration for operators conducting Specific category operations or Open category operations with drones heavier than 250 grams, adherence to insurance requirements, pilot certification verification, and equipment compliance with EASA technical standards. These findings are based on a high confidence level of 100% across multiple sources.",
